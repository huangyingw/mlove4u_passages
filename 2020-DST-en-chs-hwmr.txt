标语
①神对付爱祂的人，目的乃是要使他们最完满
地得着祂，远超过他们在祂之外所亏损的
一切，使祂能借着他们得着彰显，以成就
祂造人的目的。
②约伯是一个好人，彰显自己的完全、正直和
纯全，但神的目的是要将约伯削减至一无所
有，但维持他的生存，使神得以分赐到他里
面，并使他成为神人，彰显神圣的属性。
③神对付祂圣民的目的，乃是要使他们倒空
一切，单单接受神，作他们所赢得的；神
心头的愿望乃是要他们完满的得着祂作生
命，作生命的供应，并作他们全人的一切。
④当神所拣选并救赎的人经历基督作为从神给他
们的智慧，有分于并享受基督的丰富时，这些
丰富就把他们构成召会；借着召会，诸天界里
执政和掌权的天使，就得知神万般的智慧。

KEY STATEMENTS
① God’s purpose in dealing with those who love Him is that they may gain
Him to the fullest extent, surpassing the loss of all that they have other than
Him, so that He might be expressed through them for the fulfillment of His
purpose in creating man.
② Job was a good man, expressing himself in his perfection, uprightness, and
integrity, but God’s intention was that Job would be reduced to nothing, be
maintained in his existence, have God imparted into him, and become a Godman, expressing the divine attributes.

③ God’s purpose in dealing with His holy people is that they would be
emptied of everything and receive only God as their gain; the desire of God’s
heart is that they would gain Him in full as life, as the life supply, and as
everything to their being.
④ When God’s chosen and redeemed people experience Christ as wisdom to
them from God and partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ, these riches
will constitute them the church, through which the multifarious wisdom of
God is made known to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenlies.

A. Job said to God, “Make known to me why You contend with me”
(10:2b); “You have hidden these things in Your heart; / I know that
this is with You” (v. 13).

B. This indicates that Job could not find the reason for God’s treatment of
him, but he believed that there had to be some reason hidden in God’s
heart; what was hidden in God’s heart was the mystery of the ages—
the eternal economy of God—Eph. 3:9.

§Day 2 & Day 3

贰 对这个重大问题的重大答案，乃是历世历代隐 II. The great answer to this great question is the mystery hidden
in God throughout the ages, the eternal economy of God,
藏在神里的奥秘，神永远的经纶，就是神永远
which is God’s eternal intention with His heart’s desire to
的目的同祂心头的愿望，要将祂自己在祂神圣

consummate in the New Jerusalem—1 Tim. 1:3-4; Eph. 1:22路撒冷—提前一 3 ～ 4，弗一 22 ～ 23，三 9，
23; 3:9, 19; Gen. 1:26; Isa. 43:7; Rom. 8:29; 1 John 3:2:
19，创一 26，赛四三 7，罗八 29，约壹三 2：
一 约伯和他的朋友认为，约伯受苦是遭受神的审
判；然而，约伯的受苦不是神的审判，乃是神
的剥夺和销毁，使神可以得着约伯，好使他更
多得着神。
二 神虽然剥夺约伯，但神的确没有向他发怒；神
并没有以约伯为敌人，乃以他为亲密的朋友—
伯十九 11，参十 13。
三 神知道约伯经过一段受苦的时间，就会由神圣
三一重新建立起来，成为另一个人—新人，新
造，（加六 15，）以成就神永远的经纶，使神
得着彰显；（林后五 17；）这是给约伯记里重
大问题的重大答案。
四 我们读圣经时，需要将我们的注意力集中在神
那为着神圣分赐的永远经纶上；除非我们认识
神的经纶，否则我们就无法明白圣经；神在约
伯身上的目的是要使约伯成为属神的人，按着
神的神圣经纶由神所构成：
1 圣经六十六卷书只为着一件事：神在基督里借着那
灵，要将祂自己分赐到我们里面，作我们的生命、
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 1 周纲要 - 第 2 页

A. Job and his friends thought that what he was suffering was a matter
of God’s judgment; however, Job’s sufferings were not God’s judgment
but God’s stripping and consuming that God might gain Job so that he
might gain God more.
B. Although God was stripping Job, He surely was not angry with him;
neither did God consider Job to be His adversary but His intimate
friend—Job 19:11; cf. 10:13.

C. God knew that after Job had passed through a time of suffering, he
would be rebuilt with the Divine Trinity so that he could become
another person—a new man, a new creation (Gal. 6:15), to fulfill God’s
eternal economy for God’s expression (2 Cor. 5:17); this is the great
answer to the great question in the book of Job.

D. In our reading of the Bible, we need to focus our attention on God’s
eternal economy for the divine dispensing; unless we know God’s
economy, we will not understand the Bible; God’s intention with
Job was to make Job a man of God, who was constituted with God
according to His divine economy:
1. The Bible of sixty-six books is for only one thing: for God in Christ by
the Spirit to dispense Himself into us to be our life, our nature, and our
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 1 - Page 2

性情和一切，好使我们能活基督并彰显基督；这该
是管制我们生活的原则—约十 10 下，林前十五 45
下，罗八 2，10，6，11，腓一 19 ～ 21 上，林后三 6。
2 神对付约伯是要把他从道德的范围带出来，带进得着
神的范围里，好使他从寻求道德的完全，转向寻求并
得着神，而不是任何别的事物；人能在神前站立，乃
是基于人得着神有多少—诗二七 8，一○五 4，腓三
8，太二五 3 ～ 4，9，箴二三 23，启三 18，林后三
18，四 17，彼前二 7，但五 27，九 23，十 11，19。
3 神对付祂圣民的目的，乃是要使他们倒空一切，单
单接受神，作他们所赢得的；祂要祂的子民越过越
多地得着祂、有分于祂、拥有祂并享受祂，而不是
其他一切的事物，直到他们的享受达到最完满的地
步，使他们成为新耶路撒冷—太五 3，诗四三 4，
七三 25 ～ 26，腓三 8 ～ 9，启二一 2。
4 这是全本新约的内在意义，作为对于约伯记里，关
于神创造人并祂对付祂选民的目的之重大问题的重
大答案。

【周四】

everything so that we may live Christ and express Christ; this should be
the principle that governs our life—John 10:10b; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2,
10, 6, 11; Phil. 1:19-21a; 2 Cor. 3:6.

2. God’s dealing with Job was to bring him out of the sphere of ethics and
into the sphere of God-gaining so that he would be turned from seeking
perfection in ethics to seeking and gaining God instead of anything else;
man’s standing before God is based on how much of God he has gained—
Psa. 27:8; 105:4; Phil. 3:8; Matt. 25:3-4, 9; Prov. 23:23; Rev. 3:18; 2 Cor.
3:18; 4:17; 1 Pet. 2:7; Dan. 5:27; 9:23; 10:11, 19.
3. God’s purpose in dealing with His holy people is that they would be
emptied of everything and receive only God as their gain; He wants
His people to gain Him, to partake of Him, to possess Him, and to enjoy
Him more and more, rather than all other things, until their enjoyment
reaches the fullest extent for them to become the New Jerusalem—Matt.
5:3; Psa. 43:4; 73:25-26; Phil. 3:8-9; Rev. 21:2.

4. This is the intrinsic significance of the entire New Testament as the great
answer to the great question in the book of Job concerning God’s purpose
in His creation of man and in His dealing with His chosen people.

§Day 4

叁 约伯的基本难处是他缺少神；在神向约伯一切的 III. Job’s basic problem was that he was short of God; in all of
God’s dealings with Job, God’s intention was to reduce Job to

是祂自己被作到我们里面（弗三 16 ～ 19）：
一 约伯是自义的，（伯六 30，九 20，二七 5 ～ 6，
三二 1，）并且满意于自己所成为的人，（十三
3，二三 3 ～ 4，三一 6，）却不知道自己在神
面前可怜的光景。（参启三 16 ～ 18。）

A. Job was self-righteous (Job 6:30; 9:20; 27:5-6; 32:1), and he was
contented with what he had become (13:3; 23:3-4; 31:6), yet he was
unaware of his miserable situation before God (cf. Rev. 3:16-18).
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 1 - Page 3

二 约伯的荣耀就是他的完全、正直，他的冠冕就
是他的纯全；神剥去他的荣耀，摘去他头上的
冠冕；（伯十九 9；）约伯原先的指望是要建立
他纯全的“树”，但神不容许这样一棵树在约
伯里面生长；反之，神将这棵树，这指望拔出来，
（10，）好使约伯被带进得着神的范围里。
三 神要约伯认识他是在错误的范围里，这范围就
是在他的完全、正直和纯全上建立自己作为旧
造里的人；约伯以这些事为荣，但神认为这些
事乃是拦阻，需要被剥夺，使约伯能接受神的
性情、生命、元素和素质，因而新陈代谢地变
化成为神人，就是在新造里彰显神并将神分赐
给别人的人—林后三 18，彼前四 10，弗三 2。
四 神在约伯身上的目的，是要拆毁那在自己的完
全和正直里天然的约伯，使神能建立一个有神
的性情和属性，得更新的约伯；圣灵的管治是
拆毁我们天然的人，构成更新的人—林后四
16 ～ 18，罗八 28 ～ 29。
五 那灵在我们里面的工作，是要为我们构成一个
新人；而那灵在外面的工作，是要借着环境拆
毁我们天然所是的每一方面；我们该与运行的
灵合作，接受神为我们所安排的环境—腓四
12，弗三 1，四 1，六 20，林前七 24。
六 在这宇宙中，苦难的主要目的，特别对神的儿
女来说，乃是要借此使神的性情得以作到人的
性情里，好使人能得着神到最完满的地步—林
后一 8 ～ 9，四 16：

B. Job’s glory was his perfection and uprightness, and his crown was his
integrity; God had stripped his glory from him and had taken away
the crown from his head (Job 19:9); Job’s hope had been to build up
the “tree” of his integrity, but God would not allow such a tree to grow
within Job; rather, God had plucked up this tree, this hope (v. 10), so
that Job would be brought into the sphere of gaining God.

C. God wanted Job to know that he was in the wrong realm of building
up himself as a man in the old creation in his perfection, uprightness,
and integrity; Job glorified himself in these things, but God considered
them as frustrations to be stripped away so that Job might receive
God in His nature, life, element, and essence and thus be metabolically
transformed to be a God-man, a man in the new creation who expresses
God and dispenses Him into others—2 Cor. 3:18; 1 Pet. 4:10; Eph. 3:2.

D. God’s intention with Job was to tear down the natural Job in his
perfection and uprightness so that He might build up a renewed Job
in God’s nature and attributes; the discipline of the Holy Spirit tears
down our natural being to constitute a renewed being—2 Cor. 4:16-18;
Rom. 8:28-29.

E. The work of the Spirit within us is to constitute a new being for us,
whereas the work of the Spirit without is to tear down every aspect
of our natural being through our environment; we should cooperate
with the operating Spirit and accept the environment that God has
arranged for us—Phil. 4:12; Eph. 3:1; 4:1; 6:20; 1 Cor. 7:24.
F. The primary purpose of suffering in this universe, particularly as it
relates to the children of God, is that through it the very nature of God
may be wrought into the nature of man so that man may gain God to
the fullest extent—2 Cor. 1:8-9; 4:16:
1. While the living God can perform many acts on man’s behalf, the life
and nature of the living God are not wrought into man; when the God of
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 1 - Page 4

作到人里面—16 节。
2 神不是以外面的作为叫人认识神的权能，乃是作工
将祂自己分授并作到人里面；神使用环境好将祂的
生命和性情作到我们里面—加四 19，林后四 7 ～
12，帖前三 3，约十六 33。
3 为了要在复活里生活并被复活的神构成，我们必须
借着“万有”被模成神长子基督的形像—罗八 28 ～
29，来十二 10，参耶四八 11。
4 当我们在受苦中，我们也许向神抱怨，但我们的抱
怨也许是向神最好的祷告，最蒙悦纳的祷告；当我
们抱怨时，神就欢乐，因为祂使万有互相效力，叫
我们得益处，使我们模成祂长子的形像—参诗一○
二标题。

【周五】

resurrection works, His life and nature are wrought into man—v. 16.

2. God is not working to make His might known in external acts but is
working to impart and work Himself into man; God uses the environment
in order to work His life and nature into us—Gal. 4:19; 2 Cor. 4:7-12; 1
Thes. 3:3; John 16:33.

3. In order to live in resurrection and be constituted with the God of
resurrection, we must be conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn
Son of God through “all things”—Rom. 8:28-29; Heb. 12:10; cf. Jer. 48:11.

4. When we are in the midst of sufferings, we may complain to God, but
our complaining may be the best prayer, the most pleasant prayer to
God; while we are complaining, God is rejoicing because He is causing all
things to work together for good that we may be conformed to the image
of His firstborn Son—cf. Psa. 102, title.

肆 三一神使人成为神，好成就祂的经纶，以 IV. The move of the Triune God to deify man for the fulfillment of

A. In our Christian life we should live by the Spirit and walk by the Spirit;
we should do everything and be everything by the Spirit, with the
Spirit, in the Spirit, and through the Spirit; thus, we need to take care
of our spirit, doing everything by exercising our spirit in order to
experience the divine Spirit living in us, making His home in us, and
transforming us—Gal. 5:16, 25; Phil. 3:3; Rom. 8:4, 6; 2 Cor. 2:12-14;
Mal. 2:15-16.

B. We should not take any action apart from the all-inclusive Spirit;
we should not face any situation or meet any need apart from the

这就是为着完成神的经纶之基督徒生活和基督

三 作基督徒和得胜者不仅困难，而且不可能；唯有

Spirit; we must learn to touch the divine Spirit in our spirit; this is the
intrinsic significance of the Christian life and the Christian work for

Phil. 3:3.

C. To be a Christian and an overcomer is not merely difficult—it is

the holy word of God to be instructed, governed, ruled, and controlled by
God’s word—Eph. 4:23; Deut. 17:18-20; Phil. 2:2, 5.

伯十 2“我要对神说，不要定我为恶；要指示我， Job 10:2 I will say to God, Do not account me wicked; make known to me
你为何与我争辩。”
why You contend with me.
13“然而你待我的这些事，早已藏在你心里；我
知道这是你的意思。”

13 But You have hidden these things in Your heart; I know that this is with
You.

约伯埋怨神，说神知道他不行恶，却不赦免他的
罪孽，反无理地恶待他，并且照着藏在神心里的，
一再地攻击他。（伯十 1 ～ 17。）约伯对神说，“要
指示我，你为何与我争辩。”（2 下。）在十三节他
继续说，“然而你待我的这些事，早已藏在你心里；
我知道这是你的意思。”这指明约伯找不出神这样
对待他的理由，但他相信，神心里隐藏着一些理由。
约伯是对的；有件事隐藏在神心里。以弗所三章九
节告诉我们隐藏在神里的奥秘，这是个历世历代的
奥秘。（约伯记生命读经，五八页。）

Job complained that God, knowing that he was not wicked and not
acquitting him of his iniquity, ill-treated him without cause on his side and
attacked him again and again according to what was hidden in God’s heart
(Job 10:1-17). Job said to God, “Make known to me why You contend with
me” (v. 2b). In verse 13 he went on to say, “You have hidden these things in
Your heart; / I know that this is with You.” This indicates that Job could not
find the reason for God’s treatment of him, but he believed that there had to
be some reason hidden in God’s heart. Job was right; something was hidden
in God’s heart. Ephesians 3:9 tells us of the mystery hidden in God. This is
the mystery of the ages. (Life-study of Job, pp. 50-51)

神按着自己的形像，照着自己的样式造人（创一
26）之后，历世历代以来将祂的目的隐藏起来；在
新约时代以前，没有向任何人揭示祂的定旨。（弗

After creating man in His image and according to His likeness (Gen.
1:26), God kept His intention hidden throughout the ages. Before the New
Testament time He did not unveil to anyone what His purpose was (Eph. 3:45). (Job 10:13, footnote 1)

Today’s Reading

In their efforts to vindicate the authenticity of the book of Job, many
readers of this book, especially among the fundamentalists and the Brethren,
have emphasized certain “golden verses.” One of these verses is 19:25:
“I know that my Redeemer lives, / And at the last He will stand upon the
earth.” This verse conveys some amount of revelation concerning Christ, the
Redeemer. Another golden verse is 42:5: “I had heard of You by the hearing
of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You.” This surely is an excellent verse.

伯记总共四十二章，留给我们一个紧要的问题，这
问题有两部分：神创造人的目的是什么，以及神对
付祂选民的目的是什么？要回答这问题，就需要整
本圣经。新约特别是回应约伯记里这个问题的长篇
答案。
约伯说他要与神理论，甚至与神在“法庭”上“诉
讼”，他作原告，神作被告。但约伯没有机会这样
作，所以关于他受苦的问题就没有答案。新约乃是
神给约伯的答案。我们可以说，新约是从神“传真”
给约伯的信息。这个“传真”，这个答案，启示神
并非审判或惩罚约伯，乃是要剥夺并销毁他，好叫
约伯能由三一神重新建造起来。虽然千千万万的人
读过新约圣经，但明白里面所记载之答案的人却不
多。因此，我们来看新约所启示给约伯之答案的紧
要方面，是极其重要的。（约伯记生命读经，六九
至七○页。）
这隐藏在神心里的奥秘乃是神永远的经纶，（弗
一 10，三 9，提前一 4，）就是神永远的目的同祂心
头的愿望，要将祂自己在祂神圣的三一里，作为父
在子里借着那灵，分赐到祂所拣选的人里面，作他
们的生命和性情，使他们与祂一样，作祂的复制，
（罗八 29，约壹三 2，）成为一个生机体，基督的
身体，就是新人，（弗二 15 ～ 16，）作神的丰满，
神的彰显，（一 22 ～ 23，三 19，）这要终极完成
于新耶路撒冷。（启二一 2 ～二二 5。）约伯不知道
神的目的，所以误会了神，以为神向他发怒，正在
审判并惩罚他。神的目的不是要审判或惩罚约伯，
乃是要把他拆毁，然后以神自己重新建造约伯，使
他成为神新造里的新人。（林后五 17，加六 15。）
这是给约伯、约伯记和约伯之表白的答案。（圣经
恢复本，伯十 13 注 1。）

二○二○年十二月半年度训练 - 第 1 周 晨兴圣言 - 第 2 页

However, in spite of verses such as these, the forty-two chapters in Job
leave us with a crucial question of two parts: What was the purpose of God
in His creating of man, and what is the purpose of God in His dealing with
His chosen people? To answer this question, we need the entire Bible. In
particular, the New Testament is a long answer to Job’s question.
Job said that he wanted to argue with God and even “litigate” with God in
“court,” making himself the plaintiff and God the defendant. But Job did not
have the opportunity to do this, and his question concerning his suffering
remained unanswered. The New Testament is God’s answer to Job. We
may say that it is a message “faxed” from God to Job. This “fax,” this answer,
reveals that God was not judging Job or punishing him but was stripping and
consuming him so that Job could be rebuilt with the Triune God. Although
millions of people have read the New Testament, not many understand the
answer that it contains. Thus, it is extremely important that we consider the
vital aspects of the answer to Job revealed in the New Testament. (Life-study
of Job, pp. 61-62)

The mystery hidden in God’s heart is God’s eternal economy (Eph. 1:10;
3:9; 1 Tim. 1:4), which is God’s eternal intention with His heart’s desire
to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity as the Father in the Son by the
Spirit into His chosen people to be their life and nature that they may be
the same as He is as His duplication (Rom. 8:29; 1 John 3:2), to become
an organism, the Body of Christ as the new man (Eph. 2:15-16), for God’s
fullness, God’s expression (Eph. 1:22-23; 3:19), which will consummate
in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2—22:5). Not knowing God’s intention, Job
misunderstood God and thought that God was angry with him and was
judging him and punishing him. God’s intention was not to judge Job or
to punish him but to tear him down and then rebuild him with Himself, to
make Job a new man in God’s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15). This is
the answer to Job, to the book of Job, and to Job’s vindication. (Job 10:13,
footnote 1)

Job 42:7 tells us that God condemned Job’s three friends for not speaking
concerning Him that which was right, as His servant Job had. Job was right in
saying that his sufferings were not a matter of God’s judgment. Job felt that,
according to his conscience, he had not done anything that required God to
come in to judge him or to punish him. Nevertheless, he was suffering and
he wanted to investigate his situation with God. Job’s three friends, however,
insisted that Job’s sufferings were a proof that he had done something wrong
and was being judged by God. Thus, God came in to condemn the three
friends and to vindicate Job to a certain extent.

Job’s three friends were not right concerning God’s purpose in dealing
with His people, because their concept was based on the principle of good
and evil, on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the sideline alongside
the tree of life as the main line.

Job was right because his concept in general was not based on the
principle of good and evil. However, he was groping in relation to the purpose
for which God deals with His people. On the negative side, he was right;
on the positive side, he was devoid of the divine revelation, not knowing
that God’s purpose in dealing with His people is that He wants His people
to gain Him, to partake of Him, to possess Him, and to enjoy Him more and
more, rather than all things, until their enjoyment reaches the fullest extent,
as the divine revelation ultimately unveils in the New Testament, that His
people may ultimately become the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the
enlargement of God. We all will become parts of the New Jerusalem.
God, in His progressive revelation, did not make His purpose in dealing
with His people clear to Job at his time. However, God did make this clear in
the New Testament to the believers. In His reply to Job, God paid no attention
to Elihu because his concept had not come up to the level of God’s ultimate
standard, though it was not wrong. Elihu, a young man, thought that he was
somebody, but he actually was nobody.
All the physical blessings with which God blessed Job were to show Job
God’s lovingkindness and faithfulness in his latter days [Job 42:10-17].
This indicates that God is perfect and kind in dealing with those who love
Him. Even today, after God deals with us by stripping us and consuming us,
and after His purpose is accomplished, God gives us His physical blessings.
However, God’s purpose in dealing with His people is not to give physical
blessings to them but to give Himself to them as their eternal portion, which
ultimately consummates in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21——22). (Life-study
of Job, pp. 158-160)

The Bible of sixty-six books is for only one thing: for God in Christ by
the Spirit to dispense Himself into us to be our life, our nature, and our
everything that we may live Christ and express Christ. This should be the
principle that governs our life. In a practical way, it should be today’s tree of
life for our enjoyment.
The Bible is not mainly a book of prophecy, teaching, or types. The Bible is
a book of God’s economy. To say merely that the Bible is a book consistently
on Christ is not adequate. The Bible is on Christ in God’s economy. God’s
economy is to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity in Christ by the Spirit
into us that we may have Him as our life, nature, and everything. When we
experience this, it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us (Gal.
2:20). This is the tree of life. (Life-study of Job, p. 51)

三一神和一切祂所拣选、救赎、重生、变化、模成、
并荣化之三部分人的调和。因此，新耶路撒冷乃是
神和人的构成，要彰显神，直到永远。
这样的看见，就是对整本圣经的概览。我们读圣
经时，需要将我们的注意力集中在神那为着神圣分
赐的永远经纶上。除非我们认识神的经纶，否则我
们就无法明白圣经。
基督不仅是圣经的中心，也是神经纶的中心和普
及。在这经纶中，基督成为肉体，上十字架，经过
钉死；从死里出来，进入复活；在复活里，祂从神
而生，成为神的长子，并且祂这末后的亚当成了赐
生命的灵，重生祂所有的信徒，使他们在生命和性
情上与祂一样，成为祂的众弟兄，并神的众子。这
些神的众子，加上神的长子，就成了一个新人，以
基督作头，召会作身体，以完成神永远的定旨，终
极完成于新耶路撒冷。
我们若看见这个关于神经纶的启示，就能明白约伯
记。约伯受神的剥夺和销毁，却不明白发生在他身上
的事。约伯只能说，“然而你待我的这些事，早已藏
在你心里；我知道这是你的意思。”（伯十 13。）他
知道神有一个定旨，却不知道神的定旨是什么。
约伯和他三个朋友—以利法、比勒达和琐法—都
是在善恶知识树的范围里。约伯的水平虽然比他的朋
友高一点，但仍和他们在同一个范围里。神要把他们
从那个范围里拯救出来，摆到生命树的范围里。神必
须作的头一件事，就是把约伯剥夺、销毁并拆毁，使
他在受苦之下成为一无所是。这成为一个根据，使神
能用神圣的三一重建约伯，使约伯能成为一个新人，
神新造的一部分，以完成神永远的经纶，使神得着彰

initiation and ends with the New Jerusalem, which is the mingling of
the Triune God and all His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed,
conformed, and glorified tripartite people. The New Jerusalem is thus a
constitution of God with man to express God for eternity.

To see this is to have an overview of the entire Bible. In our reading of the
Bible, we need to focus our attention on God’s eternal economy for the divine
dispensing. Unless we know God’s economy we will not understand the
Bible.

Christ is not only the center of the Bible but also the centrality and universality
of God’s economy. It was in this economy that Christ became incarnated, that
He went to the cross to pass through crucifixion, that He came out from death
and entered into resurrection, and that in resurrection He was begotten of God
to be God’s firstborn Son and as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit to
regenerate all His believers to make them the same as He is in life and nature
that they might become His brothers and the sons of God. These sons plus the
Firstborn all become a new man, with Him as the Head and with the church as His
Body, to carry out God’s eternal purpose to consummate in the New Jerusalem.

If we see this revelation concerning God’s economy, then we will be able to
understand the book of Job. Job suffered God’s stripping and consuming, but
he did not understand what was happening to him. Job could say, “You have
hidden these things in Your heart; / I know that this is with You” (Job 10:13).
He knew that God had a purpose, but he did not know what God’s purpose was.

Job and his three friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, were in the realm of
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Even though Job was on a somewhat
higher level than his friends, he and they were still in the same realm. God was
trying to rescue them from that realm and put them into the realm of the tree
of life. The first thing God had to do was to strip Job, consume him, and tear
him down so that he would become nothing as a person under suffering. This
became the base for God to rebuild Job with the Divine Trinity, that Job could
be a new man, a part of God’s new creation, to fulfill God’s eternal economy for
God’s expression. (Life-study of Job, pp. 58-59)

腓三 8“不但如此，我也将万事看作亏损，因我

Phil. 3:8 But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency
of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered
the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.

林后四 16“…我们外面的人虽然在毁坏，我们里
面的人却日日在更新。”

2 Cor. 4:16 …Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is
being renewed day by day.

苦难是所有住在地上之人的分。…有人以为，人

然而，许多基督徒遭遇极重的患难，也有人与神联

Suffering is the lot of all the inhabitants of the earth…. Some people
imagine that if you believe on the Lord and live in His fear, you will be
immune from all ills, yet numbers of Christians are grievously afflicted, and
some who live in vital touch with God are in constant suffering. (CWWL,
1957, vol. 3, “The Living God and the God of Resurrection,” p. 17)

早年我…研究苦难这个问题，…只能从研究中得
到以下结论：（一）人倾向于犯错，所以必须借苦
难予以改正。（二）我们需要经过苦难，才能安慰
别人，因为只有亲身受过苦的人，才能真正帮助别
人。（三）我们若要有忍耐，借苦难受管教是必须
的。…（罗五 3。）（四）我们若要模成神合用的器
皿，苦难是无法避免的。
我承认幼年所得的这四项结论都是正确的，但
未能究其全义。所有苦难的终极目标，乃是要完成
神永远的定旨。这定旨已由圣经向我们揭示，但只
能借由苦难实化在我们身上。这包括在经历上认识
神—不仅认识神是活神，也认识神是复活的神。

The suffering [in Philippians 3:8] is for the gaining of Christ. (Life-study of
Job, p. 119)

Today’s Reading

[Looking into this problem of suffering], in my early days … I was only
able to draw these conclusions from my studies: (1) Man is prone to error;
therefore, suffering is necessary for his correction. (2) Suffering is needful
if we are to comfort others, for only they who themselves have suffered can
truly help other people. (3) The discipline of suffering is essential if we are to
acquire endurance [cf. Rom. 5:3]…. (4) Suffering is inevitable if we are to be
molded into vessels that will be of use to God.

These four conclusions that I came to in my youth are all correct, but
they come short of the mark. The ultimate object of all suffering is the
accomplishment of God’s eternal purpose. That purpose has been revealed to
us through the Scriptures, but it can be realized in us only through suffering.
And its realization involves an experiential knowledge of God not only as the
living God but also as the God of resurrection.

每位得救之人的经历，多少都证明神是活神。然
而相对来说，少有得救的人领悟，住在他们里面的
神乃是复活的神。我们若不清楚活神与复活的神的
分别，在我们寻求往前时，经历上会产生许多难处。
让我简单地说明这分别。
成为肉体开始了一个时代，其中神与人，人与神
相调为一。…然而，成为肉体仅仅是这奥秘的一半，
另一半是复活。…成为肉体将神圣的内容带进属人
的生命；复活将属人的内容带进神圣的生命。神成
为肉体以后，我们就可以说，地上有一人，祂的生
命里有神圣的元素。然而，乃是在复活发生以后，
我们才能说，天上的神里面有属人的元素。这是复
活的意义！
我们为什么强调活神与复活的神之间的区别？原
因乃是，活神虽然可以为人作许多事，活神的性情
却无法与人的性情调和。另一面，当复活的神作工
时，祂的性情就作到人的性情里。…即使活神为你
作了一些事，在这之后，和先前一样，祂还是祂，
你还是你。祂为你作事，一点不叫祂将自己的性情
分授给你。活神可以为人作事，但活神的性情无法
与人的性情联结。另一面，当复活的神作工时，祂
就借着为人所作的事，把自己传输给人。
在这宇宙中，苦难的主要目的，特别对神的儿
女来说，乃是要借此使神的性情得以作到人的性情
里。…（林后四 16。）借着外面毁坏的过程，里面
的过程得以发生，将新的构成成分加到我们的生命
里。（活神与复活的神，二五至二七、三三页。）

Every saved person [has] some evidence that God is the living God, but
comparatively few of the saved realize that the God who dwells within them is
the God of resurrection. If the distinction between the living God and the God
of resurrection is not clear to us, many problems will arise in our experience
as we seek to press on. Let me explain this distinction quite simply.

With the incarnation a dispensation began in which God and man, man
and God, were blended into one…. But the incarnation is only one-half of the
mystery. The other half is the resurrection….The incarnation brought divine
content into human life; the resurrection brought human content into divine
life. After the incarnation it was possible to say, “There is a man on earth
in whose life there is a divine element.” But not until after the resurrection
was it possible to say, “There is a God in heaven in whom there is a human
element.” That is the meaning of the resurrection.

But why do we stress the distinction between the living God and the God of
resurrection? It is because while the living God can perform many acts on man’s
behalf, the nature of the living God cannot blend with the nature of man. When,
on the other hand, the God of resurrection works, His very nature is wrought
into the nature of man…. Even when the living God has performed some act on
your behalf, after that act as before it, He is still He, and you are still you. His
working on your behalf does not impart anything of His nature into you. The
living God can work on behalf of man, but the nature of the living God cannot
unite with the nature of man. On the other hand, when the God of resurrection
works, He communicates Himself to man by that which He does for him.

The primary purpose of suffering in this universe, particularly as it
relates to the children of God, is that through it the very nature of God may
be wrought into the nature of man [cf. 2 Cor. 4:16]….Through a process
of outward decay, an inward process is taking place that is adding a new
constituent to our lives. (CWWL, 1957, vol. 3, “The Living God and the God of
Resurrection,” pp. 18-20, 24)

我们基督徒的生活中，我们基督徒该只摸这灵。我
们既凭着灵得生并活着，就当凭着灵而行。（加五
25，罗八 4。）我们一切所作所是都该凭着灵、同着
灵、在灵里并借着灵。

Galatians 3:14 shows us that the Spirit is the aggregate, the totality, of
the [all-embracing and all-inclusive] divine blessing of the gospel given
to us…. Such a blessing includes redemption, regeneration, the divine life,
righteousness, justification, sanctification, transformation, and renewing.
Today in our Christian life we Christians should just deal with this Spirit.
Since we have life and live by Him, we also should walk by Him (Gal. 5:25;
Rom. 8:4). We should do everything and be everything by the Spirit, with the
Spirit, in the Spirit, and through the Spirit.

加拉太六章十八节指明，那灵作为包罗万有的
恩，与我们的灵同在。我们必须宝贝加拉太书里的
两个灵：神的灵，对我们是神圣福分的集大成；人
的灵，作神的灵的接受器、容器、储存器。因此，
我们需要顾到我们的灵，作一切事都要操练我们的
灵。这样，我们就经历神的灵在我们里面活着、在
我们里面安家、并变化我们。（约伯记生命读经，

Galatians 6:18 indicates that the Spirit as the all-inclusive grace is with
our spirit. We must treasure the two spirits in Galatians—the divine Spirit as
the aggregate of the divine blessing to us and the human spirit as the receiver,
the container, the keeper, of the divine Spirit. Thus, we need to take care of
our spirit, doing everything by exercising our spirit. Then we will experience
the divine Spirit living in us, making His home in us, and transforming us.

tripartite man. This is the divine revelation in the New Testament as the
answer to the sufferings of Job and to the great question concerning God’s
purpose in His creation of man and in His dealing with His chosen people.

We should not take any action apart from the all-inclusive Spirit. We
should not face any situation or meet any need apart from the Spirit…. We
need to practice this in our married life. If you desire to say something
to your spouse, you should wait for a period of time, until you have the
assurance that your speaking is the move of the Spirit.
Acting hastily is the living of a descendant of Adam. Those who live in that
way are quick to speak, to act, and to deal with others. We must remember
that, as Christians, we are not the only ones moving. On the contrary, we are
moving in another One’s moving, and another One is moving in our moving.
This kind of life is a constituent of the church. This kind of life keeps the Body
of Christ in a living condition. However, not to move in the Spirit’s move and
not to have the Spirit in our move will bring death into the church.
Revelation 22:17 does not say that the Spirit speaks with the bride; rather,
this verse says, “The Spirit and the bride say….” The two speak together. This
indicates that we should not merely speak with the Spirit; we and the Spirit
should speak together. If this is the case, our speaking will be living and full
of impact. The way we must take today is the way of moving in the move of
the Spirit and of having the Spirit moving in our move.

In the New Testament we are charged to be regenerated by this Spirit and
to receive the divine life through this Spirit. Then we need to live, to walk, by
this Spirit, and we need to experience Christ, to enjoy God the Father, and even
to enjoy the fullness of the Triune God by doing everything according to the
Spirit. As long as we do everything according to the Spirit, we can experience
Christ’s incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension with
the outpouring of the Spirit. This will cause us to be the church of God, the
Body of Christ, the new man, and the organism of the Triune God, which will
consummate in the New Jerusalem. (Life-study of Job, pp. 94-95, 131, 71-72)

信息选读

Job did not understand the reason for his sufferings, but today we know
the reason. It was true that Job suffered, but his suffering was allowed by
God for a purpose. God wanted to take away all his successes. Job was very
successful, both materially and ethically. He had attained to a very high
degree of perfection and uprightness. That was his integrity, and he was
proud of it…. However, God took these away in order that Job would pursue
God Himself instead of other things.
Eventually, Job recognized that he had known God only “by the hearing of
the ear” (Job 42:5a). He had heard about God and he had believed in God, but
he had never seen God. However, through all the strippings and consumings,
the time came when Job saw God (42:5b).

[In Matthew 5:8] seeing God is a great reward in the kingdom. According
to the clear view in the New Testament, to see God is to receive God into
us. If seeing God is merely an objective seeing of God and nothing else, that
means very little. But seeing God is to receive God, and this means that God
comes into us as our element to renew us, to transform us, because God’s
coming in adds the divine element into our being. This divine element works
on us and in us to renew us, discharging all our old element. Eventually, our
entire being becomes new. This is transformation. (Life-study of Job, pp.
116-117)

到另一种程度的荣耀；这乃是从主灵变化成的。
约伯所看见的神也是灵，但那时神还在祂原来的
状态中；神有神圣的元素和祂神圣的属性，但没有
成为肉体、人性、和人性生活的元素。…我们今天
所观看的这一位神却大不相同，因为祂在成分上是
更丰富了。〔参林后三 18。〕因此，我们越观看祂，
就越把祂的成分接受到我们里面，作我们里面的供
应，在我们身上作工，排除旧的元素，使我们成为
新的。这就是将我们变化成为神的形像。
今天我们观看神完全是在灵里的事。我们所观看
的这一位神，乃是终极完成的灵；我们能看见祂，
乃是在我们的灵里。有时我们太忙或太轻忽，没有
抓住机会观看主。我们早上晨兴，即使只有十五或
二十分钟，也是与主同在，留在灵里的时间。在这
段时间里，我们可以祷读主话，与祂谈话，用简短

transformed into His glorious image, from one degree of glory to another.
This is from the Lord Spirit.

The God whom Job saw was also the Spirit, but at that time God was still
in His original state. God had His divine element with His divine attributes,
but He did not have anything related to incarnation, humanity, and human
living….The God whom we are looking at today is different, for He is much
richer in His ingredients [cf. 2 Cor. 3:18]. Hence, the more we look at Him, the
more we receive His ingredients into our being as our inner supply to work
on us, to discharge the old, and to make us new. This is to transform us into
God’s image.

Our way of looking at God today is altogether a matter in the spirit. The
God whom we may look at is the consummated Spirit, and we can look at
Him in our spirit. Sometimes we are too busy or too careless to take the
opportunity to look at the Lord. In our morning watch, even if only for fifteen
or twenty minutes, we have time to be with the Lord, time to remain in the
Spirit. At such a time we may pray-read His word, talk to Him, or pray to
Him with short prayers. Then we will have the sense that we are receiving
something of God’s element, that we are absorbing the riches of God into our
being. In this way we are under the divine transformation day by day.
Our Christian life is a life not of changing outwardly but of being
transformed from within by having the divine element added into our inner
being to replace our old element. This is altogether by our looking at the
processed and consummated God, who is the all-inclusive Spirit.

By reading Job’s final word in Job 30, we can realize that Job and his friends
were walking on the way of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They
were not in the realm of endeavoring to see God in order to learn of Him and
especially to receive Him so that they could be transformed with His element
and essence to be made the same as God in life and in nature. We all need to
see a clear comparison between the way taken by Job and his friends and the
way revealed in the New Testament. (Life-study of Job, pp. 117-118)

Scripture Reading: Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7; Matt. 12:26; Heb. 2:14; Rom. 16:20; Rev. 12:5,
7-11

Outline
§Day 1

壹 全本圣经就是记载神、人、和撒但的事； I. The entire Bible is a record of the things concerning God,
man, and Satan; therefore, in our reading of the Bible, we
所 以 我 们 读 圣 经， 不 仅 要 懂 得 神 的 事 和
need to know not only the things concerning God and man
人的事，还必须懂得撒但的事—创一 1，
but also the things concerning Satan—Gen. 1:1, 26-28; 3:1, 4,
26 ～ 28，三 1，4，15，赛十四 12 ～ 14，
15; Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:12-19:
结二八 12 ～ 19：
一 撒但原是神在创造地以前所创造的一个天使和
受膏的基路伯；他原是天使当中最高的一位—
12 ～ 15 节，伯三八 4 ～ 7：

1 撒 但 原 是“ 明 亮 之 星， 清 晨 之 子 ”，（ 赛 十 四
12，）是神在宇宙之“晨”所创造最初期的天使之
一，受神指派作了天使长。（结二八 14，犹 9。）
2 受膏的基路伯为神所派管理亚当以前的宇宙；（路
四 6；）受膏的基路伯是最靠近神的，兼有君王职
分和祭司职分，在神的造物中掌有最高的地位。（结
二八 13。）

二 撒但对神的背叛启示于以赛亚十四章十三至
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 2 周纲要 - 第 1 页

A. Satan was an angel and an anointed cherub created by God before
God created the earth; he was the highest among the angels—vv. 1215; Job 38:4-7:

1. Satan was the “Daystar, son of the dawn” (Isa. 14:12), one of the first
angels created by God at the “dawn” of the universe, appointed by God to
be the head of all the angels (Ezek. 28:14; Jude 9).
2. The anointed cherub was appointed by God to rule over the preadamic
universe (Luke 4:6); the anointed cherub was the one closest to God, and
having both the kingship and the priesthood, he held the highest position
in God’s creation (Ezek. 28:13).

B. Satan’s rebellion against God is revealed in Isaiah 14:13-14 and
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 2 - Page 1

十四节和以西结二十八章十五至十八节：
1 撒但背叛神是由于他心里骄傲；他因美丽心中高
傲—赛十四 13 ～ 14，结二八 17。
2 撒但背叛的意图乃是要推翻神的权柄，高举自己与
神同等；在他对神的背叛里，他要与神同等—赛
十四 13。

三 因着背叛，撒但就成了神的对头，神的仇敌—
亚三 1 ～ 2，启十二 9 上，二十 2 上：
1 “撒但”意“对头”；撒但是神的对头，是与神作
对的—伯一 7，12，二 1，6，启二十 2。
2 “仇敌”是指在神国之外的敌人，而“对头”则指
在神国之内的敌人。
3 撒但不仅在神国之外作神的仇敌，也在神国之内作
神的对头，背叛神。

【周二】

Ezekiel 28:15-18:

1. Satan rebelled against God because of the pride in his heart; his heart was
lifted up because of his beauty—Isa. 14:13-14; Ezek. 28:17.

2. Satan’s intention was to overthrow God’s authority and to exalt himself
to be equal with God; in his rebellion against God, Satan wanted to be on
the same level as God—Isa. 14:13.

C. Because of his rebellion, Satan became God’s adversary, God’s
enemy—Zech. 3:1-2; Rev. 12:9a; 20:2a:

1. Satan means “adversary”; as God’s adversary, Satan opposes God—Job
1:7, 12; 2:1, 6; Rev. 20:2.

2. Enemy refers to the foe outside of God’s kingdom, whereas adversary
refers to the foe from within God’s kingdom.
3. Satan is not only God’s enemy outside of God’s kingdom but also God’s
adversary from within God’s kingdom, rebelling against God.

§Day 2

贰 约伯记一至二章的景象描述在天上所举行 II. The scene in Job 1 and 2 depicts two councils held in heaven
concerning Job—1:6-12; 2:1-7:
关于约伯的两次会议—一 6 ～ 12，二 1 ～ 7：
一 因着神对约伯有爱的关切，所以就在天上举行
两次会议讨论约伯—一 6，二 1。

二 “神的众子”，就是众天使，来侍立在耶和华面
前，撒但，就是那对头，也来在其中—一 6，二 1，
三八 7，参王上二二 19 ～ 23，诗八九 5 ～ 8：
1 撒但背叛神以后，已经被神定罪，甚至受神判刑—
赛十四 12 ～ 15，结二八 12 ～ 19。
2 撒但进到神面前的权利仍未从他夺去—参启十二
10。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 2 周纲要 - 第 2 页

A. Because of His loving concern for Job, God held two councils in the
heavens to talk about Job—1:6; 2:1.

B. The “sons of God,” the angels, came to present themselves before
Jehovah, and Satan, the adversary, also came among them—1:6; 2:1;
38:7; cf. 1 Kings 22:19-23; Psa. 89:5-8:

1. After he rebelled against God, Satan was condemned and even sentenced
by God—Isa. 14:12-15; Ezek. 28:12-19.
2. Satan’s right to enter into the presence of God has not yet been taken
away from him—cf. Rev. 12:10.
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 2 - Page 2

三 神按祂的智慧和主宰的权柄，还未在撒但身上执
行祂的审判，反而给撒但有限的时间，让他作些
事，好应付一些消极的需要，以完成祂的经纶：
1 神不能，也不愿要求祂众多良好天使中的任何一
位，来作伤害约伯所必须的事，就是剥夺他的一切，
使他能被神充满—伯一 1，8，11 ～ 12，二 3 ～ 7。
2 撒但是宇宙中唯一的一位，能够且愿意完成神这目
的，就是剥夺约伯的家产和道德成就—3 节。
3 约伯记一至二章的景象给我们看见，撒但仍是自由
的，好被神特意用作丑恶的工具，以执行神对爱祂
之人严厉的对付—参路二二 31 ～ 32。

【周三】

C. In His wisdom and sovereignty God did not execute His judgment on
Satan but has given Satan a certain limited time to do something to
meet some negative need in the fulfillment of His economy:
1. God could not and would not ask any of His many excellent angels to do
what was needed to damage Job in order to strip him of everything so
that he might be full of God—Job 1:1, 8, 11-12; 2:3-7.

2. Satan was the unique one in the universe who could and who would
fulfill God’s intention of stripping Job of his possessions and ethical
attainment—v. 3.
3. The scene in chapters 1 and 2 of Job shows us that Satan remains free to
be purposely used by God as an ugly tool to execute God’s severe dealing
with His loving ones—cf. Luke 22:31-32.

§Day 3

叁 撒但有他的国，就是黑暗的权势—太十二 III. Satan has his kingdom, the authority of darkness—Matt.
12:26; Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13:
26，徒二六 18，西一 13：
一 撒但有他的权势（徒二六 18）和他的使者，（太
二五 41，）就是他的从属，是这黑暗世界的执
政者、掌权者和管辖者；因此，他有他的国，
就是黑暗的权势。（西一 13。）

二 撒但是这世界的王和空中掌权者的首领—约
十二 31，弗二 2：
1 “灵”（2）与“空中掌权者”是同位语，指集体的
权势，就是一切邪恶天使权势的集合，由撒但为其
首领。
2 当我们死在过犯并罪之中，（1，）我们的行事为人
随着“这世界的世代”，（2，）就是世界时髦的表
现，现今的潮流，就是撒但的系统。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 2 周纲要 - 第 3 页

A. Satan has his authority (Acts 26:18) and his angels (Matt. 25:41), who
are his subordinates as rulers, authorities, and world-rulers of the
darkness of this world; hence, he has his kingdom, the authority of
darkness (Col. 1:13).

B. Satan is the ruler of this world and the ruler of the authority of the
air—John 12:31; Eph. 2:2:

1. The spirit (v. 2), in apposition to the authority of the air, refers to the
aggregate power, the aggregate of all the evil angelic authorities, over
which Satan is the ruler.
2. When we were dead in offenses and sins (v. 1), we walked according to
“the age of this world” (v. 2), the modern appearance, the present course,
of the world, the satanic system.
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 2 - Page 3

3 那些执政的、掌权的、和管辖这黑暗世界的，乃是
背叛的天使；他们跟从撒但一同背叛、抵挡神，现
今在诸天界里管辖世上的列国—但十 20。
4 这指明魔鬼撒但有他的国，他在其中居于最高位，
在他以下有背叛的天使。

3. The rulers, the authorities, and the world-rulers of this darkness are the
rebellious angels, who followed Satan in his rebellion against God and
who now rule in the heavenlies over the nations of the world—Dan. 10:20.

4. This indicates that the devil, Satan, has his kingdom in which he occupies
the highest position and in which the rebellious angels are under him.

肆 主耶稣借着祂在地上的职事和祂在十字架 IV. Through His ministry on earth and His death on the cross,
the Lord Jesus was victorious over Satan—1 John 3:8; Matt.
上的死，胜过了撒但—约壹三 8，太二七
27:51-53; Col. 2:14-15; Heb. 2:14:
51 ～ 53，西二 14 ～ 15，来二 14：
一 得胜的基督在祂地上的职事里击败魔鬼并消除
魔鬼的作为—太四 1 ～ 11，约壹三 8：

1 主耶稣要为着诸天的国完成祂的职事，就必须击败
神的仇敌，就是魔鬼撒但—太四 1，11：
a 祂必须以人的身分作这事；因此，祂站在人的地位
上，面对神的仇敌—6 ～ 7 节。
b 魔鬼对头一个人亚当的试诱成功了，但他对第二个
人基督的试诱，却完全失败了—11 节。
2 主耶稣在祂地上的职事里，消除了魔鬼的作为—约
壹三 8：
a 在约壹三章八节，按原文，“消除”也可译为“解
除”或“毁坏”。
b 为这缘故，神的儿子显现出来，要解除并毁坏魔鬼
罪恶的作为，就是借着祂在十字架上的死，在肉体
中定罪那恶者所起始的罪；毁坏罪的权势，就是魔
鬼罪恶的性情；并且除去罪与诸罪—罗八 3，来二
14，约一 29。

二 得胜的基督在祂钉十字架时，赶出这世界的
王，废除魔鬼，使执政的和掌权的被脱下，并
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 2 周纲要 - 第 4 页

A. In His earthly ministry the victorious Christ defeated the devil and
destroyed his works—Matt. 4:1-11; 1 John 3:8:

1. For Him to accomplish His ministry for the kingdom of the heavens, the
Lord Jesus had to defeat God’s enemy, the devil, Satan—Matt. 4:1, 11:
a. This He had to do as a man; hence, He stood as a man to confront the enemy
of God—vv. 6-7.
b. The devil’s temptation of the first man, Adam, was a success; his temptation
of the second man, Christ, was an absolute failure—v. 11.
2. In His ministry on earth the Lord Jesus destroyed the works of the
devil—1 John 3:8:
a. In 1 John 3:8 the Greek word translated “destroy” may also be translated
“undo” or “dissolve.”

b. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might undo and
destroy the sinful deeds of the devil, that is, condemn, through His death on
the cross in the flesh, sin initiated by him, the evil one; destroy the power of
sin, the sinful nature of the devil; and take away both sin and sins—Rom. 8:3;
Heb. 2:14; John 1:29.

B. In His crucifixion the victorious Christ cast out the ruler of this world,
destroyed the devil, caused the rulers and authorities to be stripped

把死废掉—十二 31，太二七 51，来二 14，西二
15，提后一 10：
1 基督在祂十字架的工作里，赶出这世界的王，并审
判世界—约十二 31：
a 撒但因着基督在祂死里的工作被赶出去时，这世界
的王就被赶出去；同时，与撒但有关的世界系统就
受了审判—约壹五 19。
b 撒但背叛的根基动摇了，并且撒但属地之国的营垒
崩溃了—太二七 51。
2 基督在钉十字架时，废除了魔鬼—来二 14：
a 在希伯来二章十四节里，“废除”这辞原文也可译为，
使之归于无有，使之失效，废掉，消除，取消，弃绝。
b 基督在祂的人性里，借着祂在十字架上的工作，废
除了魔鬼—约三 14。
3 基督在祂十字架的工作里，使神得以将执政的和掌
权的天使脱下，把他们公然示众，并在凯旋中向他
们夸胜—西二 15。
4 基督在祂十字架的工作里，借着祂废除魔鬼的死，
（ 来 二 14，） 并 祂 吞 灭 死 的 复 活，（ 林 前 十 五
52 ～ 54，）把死废掉，使其失效—提后一 10。

三 借着国度的福音，神将人带到诸天掌权的管治
之下，使他们成为祂的国度，就是受祂权柄管
理的人—太二四 14，启一 5 ～ 6。

【周四】

off, and nullified death—12:31; Matt. 27:51; Heb. 2:14; Col. 2:15; 2
Tim. 1:10:

1. In His work on the cross, Christ cast out the ruler of this world and
judged the world—John 12:31:

a. The ruler of this world was cast out when Satan was cast out by Christ’s
work in His death; simultaneously, the world system related to Satan was
judged—1 John 5:19.
b. The base of Satan’s rebellion was shaken, and the strongholds of Satan’s
earthly kingdom were broken—Matt. 27:51.
2. In His crucifixion Christ destroyed the devil—Heb. 2:14:

a. In verse 14 the Greek word translated “destroy” can also be rendered as “bring
to nought, make of none effect, do away with, abolish, annul, discard.”

b. In His humanity and through His work on the cross, Christ has destroyed the
devil—John 3:14.
3. In His work on the cross, Christ caused the angelic rulers and authorities
to be stripped off, to be made a display of openly, and to be triumphed
over by God—Col. 2:15.

4. In His work on the cross, Christ nullified death, making it of none effect,
through His devil-destroying death (Heb. 2:14) and death-swallowing
resurrection (1 Cor. 15:52-54)—2 Tim. 1:10.

C. Through the gospel of the kingdom, God brings people under the ruling
of the heavenly authority so that they may become His kingdom, those
who are ruled by His authority—Matt. 24:14; Rev. 1:5-6.

§Day 4

伍 作为在基督耶稣里的信徒和神的儿女，我 V. As believers in Christ Jesus and children of God, we need to
learn to be victorious in Christ over Satan—Eph. 6:12; 1 Pet.
们需要学习在基督里胜过撒但—弗六 12，
5:8-9; 1 John 5:18:
彼前五 8 ～ 9，约壹五 18：
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 2 周纲要 - 第 5 页

2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 2 - Page 5

一 我们不该不晓得撒但的阴谋—林后二 11：
1 译为“阴谋”的原文，意即计划、策略、企图、计谋、
打算、目的。
2 那恶者撒但，在每件事的幕后藏着，在每件事，甚
至在召会生活里面作祟。

二 我们需要穿戴神全副的军装，使我们能以站住，
抵挡魔鬼的诡计—弗六 11：
1 魔鬼不但有邪恶的意图，也有狡诈的诡计来行出他
的意图；这些诡计乃是他邪恶的计谋。
2 穿戴神全副的军装，就使我们能以站住，抵挡魔鬼
的诡计—11 节。
3 撒但迫害至高者圣民的其中一个诡计是折磨他们；
（但七 21，25；）当我们看见撒但正在折磨我们时，
就有能力抵挡并反对他折磨人的计谋。

三 我们需要儆醒防备我们的对头，魔鬼，“如同吼叫
的狮子，遍地游行，寻找可吞吃的人”—彼前五 8：
1 儆醒犹如战争中的警备，如同在前线的士兵。
2 彼前五章八节的“儆醒”一辞含示争战；我们乃是
在争战之中，我们需要警备。
3 我们若警备，就会抵挡我们的对头，在信上坚固—
9 节：
a 抵挡不是反抗，也不是苦斗，乃是在吼叫的魔鬼面
前，在我们信的立场上站稳如磐石。
b 彼前五章九节里的信，实际是说你们的信，指信徒
主观的信，就是相信神保护的能力和爱的关切。

四 我们胜过撒但最好的路乃是活在调和的灵里—
林前六 17，约壹五 18：
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 2 周纲要 - 第 6 页

A. We should not be ignorant of Satan’s schemes—2 Cor. 2:11:

1. The Greek word translated “schemes” means “plans, plots, designs, wiles,
intentions, purposes.”
2. The evil one, Satan, is behind the scenes in everything and works in
everything, even in the church life.

B. We need to put on the whole armor of God so that we may be able to
stand against the stratagems of the devil—Eph. 6:11:

1. The devil has not only evil intentions but also deceptive stratagems to
work out his intentions; these stratagems are his evil plots.
2. Putting on the whole armor of God enables us to stand against the
stratagems of the devil—v. 11.

3. One of Satan’s stratagems against the saints of the Most High is to wear
them out (Dan. 7:21, 25); when we see that Satan is wearing us out, we
will have the power to withstand and oppose his wearing-out tactics.

C. We need to be watchful against our adversary, the devil, who “as a
roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour”—1 Pet. 5:8:
1. To be watchful is to be vigilant as in warfare, as with soldiers on the frontier.

2. The word watch in 1 Peter 5:8 implies fighting; we are involved in a
warfare, and we need to be vigilant.

3. If we are vigilant, we will withstand our adversary, being firm in our
faith—v. 9:
a. To withstand is not to resist nor to struggle against but to stand firmly, like a
rock, on the ground of our faith before the roaring devil.

b. Your faith in 1 Peter 5:9 refers to the believers’ subjective faith, their faith in
God’s protecting power and loving concern.

D. The best way for us to be victorious over Satan is to live in the
mingled spirit—1 Cor. 6:17; 1 John 5:18:
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 2 - Page 6

1 只有一个地方是撒但不能侵入的，就是我们的灵—
提后四 22。
2 我们是否在撒但的权下，不在于我们所作的事，
乃 在 于 我 们 是 在 灵 里， 还 是 在 肉 体 里 — 加 五
16 ～ 17。
3 只要我们留在调和的灵里，我们就蒙保守，撒但就对
我们没有办法—林前六 17，约壹五 4 ～ 5，18 ～ 21。

【周五】

1. There is only one place that Satan cannot invade—our spirit—2 Tim. 4:22.

2. Whether or not we are under Satan’s authority is not determined by the
things we do; rather, it is determined by whether we are in the spirit or
in the flesh—Gal. 5:16-17.
3. As long as we remain in the mingled spirit, we will be kept, and Satan will
have no way with us—1 Cor. 6:17; 1 John 5:4-5, 18-21.

§Day 5

陆 “ 平 安 的 神 快 要 将 撒 但 践 踏 在 你 们 的 脚 VI. “The God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly”—
Rom. 16:20:
下”—罗十六 20：
一 践踏撒但与召会生活有关；召会生活是神胜过
撒但最有力的凭借—20，1，16 节下。
二 罗马十六章二十节的“你们的”在原文是复数，
指基督的身体—十二 5：
1 罗马十六章不是指宇宙的身体，乃是指身体在地方
上实际的彰显。
2 对付撒但乃是身体的事，不是个人的事。
3 撒但只能被践踏在那实际彰显于众地方召会之基督
身体的脚下—十二 5，十六 1，4，16 下。
4 唯有当我们有正当的地方召会，作身体实际的出
现，才会将撒但践踏在脚下—20 节。

三 将撒但践踏在我们脚下的那一位是平安的神，
这是很有意义的—20 节：
1 和平的神是那圣别人的，祂的圣别带来和平—帖前
五 23。
2 当我们从里面被祂全然圣别时，就在凡事上与祂与
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 2 周纲要 - 第 7 页

A. The crushing of Satan is related to the church life—the strongest
means by which God overcomes Satan—vv. 20, 1, 16b.
B. The Greek word rendered “your” in Romans 16:20 is plural; this
points to the Body—12:5:

1. Romans 16 does not refer to the Body in a universal sense but to the local
and practical expression of the Body.
2. Dealing with Satan is a Body matter, not an individual matter.

3. Satan can be crushed only under the feet of the practical expression of
the Body in the local churches—12:5; 16:1, 4, 16b.

4. It is only when we have a proper local church as the practical expression
of the Body that Satan is crushed under our feet—v. 20.

C. It is significant that the One who crushes Satan under our feet is the
God of peace—v. 20:

1. The God of peace is the Sanctifier; His sanctification brings in peace—1
Thes. 5:23.
2. When we are wholly sanctified by Him from within, we have peace with

人都有和平—13 节，罗六 19，22，来十三 12。
3 神的平安保卫（守卫）我们的心怀意念，因为平安
的神在基督里，在我们的心怀意念前巡查，保守我
们平静安宁—腓四 7。

【周六】

Him and with man in every way—v. 13; Rom. 6:19, 22; Heb. 13:12.

3. The peace of God guards, mounts guard over, our hearts and our thoughts
because the God of peace patrols before our hearts and thoughts in
Christ, keeping us calm and tranquil—Phil. 4:7.

§Day 6

柒 男孩子被提到神的宝座那里之后，天上就 VII.After the man-child is raptured to the throne of God, there
is war in heaven, Satan and his angels are cast down to the
有争战，撒但和他的使者要被摔在地上，
earth, and the kingdom of God is manifested—Rev. 12:5, 7-11:
并且神的国要显明—启十二 5，7 ～ 11：
一 男孩子是由得胜者所组成，他们替召会站住，
站在全召会所当站的地位上，替召会作事情—
二 7 下，11 下，十二 5：
1 男孩子在地上总是不断从事与神仇敌撒但的争战。
2 天正等待男孩子—得胜者—到达那里，好进行争
战，把撒但从天上摔下去：
a 得胜的信徒和撒但争战，实际上就是执行主对撒但
的审判—约十二 31。
b 至终，借着他们的争战，撒但要从天上被摔下去—
启十二 8 ～ 9。

二 魔鬼，那控告者，现今在神面前昼夜控告信徒，
但构成男孩子并受神的仇敌撒但敌对且毁谤的
得胜信徒，胜过他—10 ～ 11 节：
1 他们胜过他，是“因羔羊的血”—11 节上：
a 为着救赎我们之羔羊的血，在神面前答复魔鬼对我
们一切的控告，使我们胜过他。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 2 周纲要 - 第 8 页

A. The man-child consists of the overcomers, who stand on behalf of the
church, take the position that the whole church should take, and do
the work of the church—2:7b, 11b; 12:5:
1. The man-child is always engaged in fighting against God’s enemy, Satan,
continually on earth.
2. Heaven is waiting for the man-child, the overcomers, to arrive so that a
war may be waged to cast Satan out of heaven:

executing of the Lord’s judgment upon him—John 12:31.
b. Eventually, through their fighting, Satan is cast out of heaven—Rev.

B. The devil, the accuser, is now accusing the believers before God day
and night, but the overcoming believers who constitute the man-child
and who have been opposed and slandered by God’s enemy, Satan,
overcome him—vv. 10-11:
1. They overcome him “because of the blood of the Lamb”—v. 11a:

a. The blood of the Lamb, which is for our redemption, answers before God all
the accusations of the devil against us and gives us the victory over him.

b. Whenever we sense the devil’s accusation, we should declare with the uttered

3. The overcomers do not love their soul-life—Rev. 12:11c:

a. Not loving our soul-life is the basis for overcoming Satan, for our victory over Satan.

b. Not loving our soul-life means that we are willing to give up our own soul-life
and that we do not care for our own soul-life—Mark 8:34-35.

c. Satan is afraid of only one kind of people—those who do not love their own
soul-life—Rev. 12:11c.

C. The man-child is related to God’s most important dispensational
move—Matt. 6:9-10; Rev. 11:15; 12:10:
1. God wants to end this age and bring in the age of the kingdom, and for
this He must have the man-child as His dispensational instrument—v. 5.

2. The rapture of the man-child brings an end to the church age and
introduces the age of the kingdom—vv. 5, 10.

3. The rapture of the man-child to the throne of God, the casting of Satan
to the earth, and the declaration in heaven signify that the man-child
will bring the kingdom to the earth; this is God’s greatest dispensational
move—vv. 5, 9-10; 11:15.

Just as the Bible speaks about God and man, it also speaks about Satan.
We should not forget that immediately after man was created, God put him in
front of two trees: one was the tree of life, and the other was the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil….The tree of life denotes God and the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil denotes Satan….The entire Bible is a record of the
things concerning these three characters: [God, Satan, and man]. Therefore,
in reading the Bible, we should not only know the things concerning God
and the things concerning man, we should also know the things concerning
Satan. If we have a good grasp concerning these three lines—the line of God,
the line of man, and the line of Satan—the Bible will become crystal clear to
us. (CWWL, 1959, vol. 3, “Ten Lines in the Bible,” p. 521)

Today’s Reading

撒但的起始是美妙的，…他不只有君王职分，
也有祭司职分，那是我们蒙救赎的人永远所有的
地位。（启五 9 ～ 10，二十 4 ～ 6。）但是当他
背叛神的时候，他的地位与职分就被夺去了。如
今神拣选我们作祂的祭司与君王，以顶替撒但当
初的地位与职分，使他蒙羞，并使神得荣耀。

Satan’s origin was wonderful…. He had not only the kingship, but also the
priesthood, the very position that we, God’s redeemed people, have forever
(Rev. 5:9-10; 20:4-6). But he was deprived of his position and offices when
he rebelled against God. Now God has chosen us to be His priests and kings,
to take over Satan’s position and offices, to put him to shame, and to glorify
God.

撒但背叛神是由于他心里骄傲。以西结二十八章
十七节说，他因美丽心中高傲，又因荣光败坏智慧。
他本是“满有智慧，全然美丽”，他“完美全备”。
（12。）这是说，他有完满度量的完全，并且一无所
缺。但是他注视自己的美丽，因而骄傲。他观看自己
的荣光，就败坏了。注视神所使我们有的，而忘了神
自己，总是试诱我们骄傲。骄傲就是撒但背叛的原
因。所以使徒绝不让初信的人作召会的长老，“恐怕
他为高傲所蒙蔽，就落在魔鬼所受的审判里。”（提
前三 6。）一切天然的美德和属性，以及一切属灵的
恩赐，都可能被魔鬼利用，使我们骄傲。连使徒保罗
都可能“因所得启示的超越，就过于高抬自己”。（林
后十二 7。）那骄傲的魔鬼仍在遍地游行，寻找可吞
吃的人，就是骄傲的人。（彼前五 8。）唯一“抵挡”
他的办法，就是“降卑”自己，以谦卑束腰，因为“神
敌挡狂傲的人，赐恩给谦卑的人”。（9，5 ～ 6。）
在这事上主耶稣是一个好榜样。撒但是高抬自己，主
耶稣是“降卑自己”。（腓二 8。）因此，主胜过了
撒但，撒但在祂里面毫无所有。（约十四 30。）
撒但背叛的目的乃是要高举自己，与神同等。在
以赛亚十四章十三至十四节我们读到，撒但在背叛之
时五次说“我要…”。…撒但想要与神同等。那就是
他背叛神的目的。…要求地位的野心，成了圣经所记
载一切背叛的动机。巴别的背叛，（创十一 4，）大
坍、亚比兰、并以色列人中那二百五十个首领的背
叛，（民十六 1 ～ 3，）还有押沙龙的背叛，（撒下
十五 10 ～ 12，）都是由于要得地位的邪恶野心。但
是主耶稣“反而倒空自己，取了奴仆的形状，…所以
神将祂升为至高，又赐给祂那超乎万名之上的名”。

Satan rebelled against God because of pride in his heart. Ezekiel 28:17
says that his heart was lifted up because of his beauty, that he corrupted his
wisdom by reason of his brightness. He was “full of wisdom and perfect in
beauty”; he “sealed up perfection” (Ezek. 28:12), meaning that he had the
full measure of completeness and was short of nothing. But he gazed on his
beauty and was proud. He looked at his brightness and became corrupted. To
look at what God has made us and forget God Himself always tempts us to be
proud. Pride was the cause of Satan’s rebellion. So, the apostle would never
allow “a new convert” to be an elder in the church, “lest being blinded with
pride he fall into the judgment suffered by the devil” (1 Tim. 3:6). All the
natural virtues and attributes, and all the spiritual gifts can be utilized by the
devil to make us proud. Even the apostle Paul could be “exceedingly lifted up”
by the “transcendence of the revelations” (2 Cor. 12:7). The proud devil is still
prowling about on the earth, seeking the proud ones whom he may devour (1
Pet. 5:8). The only way to “withstand” him is to “humble” ourselves, to gird
ourselves with humility because “God resists the proud but gives grace to
the humble” (1 Pet. 5:9, 5-6). The Lord Jesus is a good example in this matter.
Satan exalted himself, but the Lord Jesus “humbled Himself” (Phil. 2:8). Thus,
the Lord overcame Satan, and Satan had nothing in Him (John 14:30).
The purpose of Satan’s rebellion was to exalt himself to be equal with
God. In Isaiah 14:13-14 we find that five times Satan said “I will,” at the time
of his rebellion…. Satan wanted to be equal with God. That was the purpose
of his rebellion against God. Ambition for position was the motivation of
every rebellion recorded in the Bible. The rebellion at Babel (Gen. 11:4), the
rebellion of Dathan, Abiram, and the two hundred and fifty princes of the
Israelites (Num. 16:1-3), and the rebellion of Absalom (2 Sam. 15:10-12)
were all because of the evil ambition for position. But the Lord Jesus “emptied
Himself, taking the form of a slave….Therefore also God highly exalted Him
and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name” (Phil. 2:7, 9).
(Life-study of Genesis, pp. 16-17)

In Isaiah 14:15 and Ezekiel 28:16-17 Satan was condemned by God
and even sentenced by God. Yet in His wisdom and sovereignty God did
not execute His judgment over Satan. He still has given Satan a certain
limited time so that he can do something to meet some negative need in the
fulfillment of God’s economy….Without Satan, there would have been no one
to do the ugly work of damaging Job in order to strip him of everything that
he might be full of God. (Life-study of Job, p. 11)

Today’s Reading

There was the need for someone to damage Job, not to judge him but
to strip him of everything. Job had been laboring under God’s blessing for
many years and he had accumulated many things. He had seven thousand
sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred
female donkeys, and a great many servants. He had a dear wife and seven
sons and three daughters. Moreover, Job was very successful in being perfect
and upright and in holding to his integrity. His possessions, success, and
attainment made him a contented and satisfied person. Although Job was
full of possessions and full of his attainment, he did not have God within him.
As God looked upon Job, He might have said, “Job, what shall I do with you?
You are full of your possessions and your attainment, but you are not full
of Me. You have Me in name, but you do not have Me within you.” Thus, for
God’s dealing with Job, Satan was needed. Satan was the unique one in the

“耶和华问撒但说，你曾用心察看我的仆人约伯

撒但回答耶和华，问祂说，“约伯敬畏神，岂是
无故呢？你岂不是四面圈上篱笆围护他和他的家，
并他一切所有的么？他手所作的，你都赐福；他的
家产也在地上大大增多。”（9 ～ 10。）神的确在
四 面 圈 上 篱 笆 围 护 约 伯， 并 赐 福 他 手 所 作 的。 在
十一节撒但继续说，“你且伸手，碰他一切所有的，
他必当面咒诅你。”

universe who could and who would fulfill God’s intention of stripping Job of
his possessions and his ethical attainment.

“Jehovah said to Satan, Have you considered My servant Job? For there
is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and
turns away from evil” (Job 1:8). Here God was boasting to Satan regarding
Job. If we read this carefully, we will see that God’s boasting here was with
the intention that Satan would do something for Him.
Satan answered Jehovah, asking Him, “Does Job fear God without cause?
Have You not set a hedge around him and his household and all that he has?
You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his possessions are spread
throughout the land” (vv. 9-10). God had set a hedge around Job, and He had
blessed the work of his hands. In verse 11 Satan went on to say, “But stretch
forth Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to
Your face.”
“Jehovah said to Satan, Here is all that he has, in your hand; only do not
stretch forth your hand against him” (v. 12a). We should not think that
God was caught by Satan, for Satan was caught by God to do something for
Him—to strip Job for God. Satan, an evil angel, was willing to do what none
of the good angels was willing to do, and he immediately accepted God’s
commission.

Satan’s evil concept concerning God’s dealing with His seeking people is
based on his commercial principle of gain or loss. Satan is a businessman, a
merchant, and his thought is according to his commercial principle. He does
not know that God’s purpose in dealing with those who love Him, even in
the way of loss, is that they may gain Him to the fullest extent, more than the
loss of all that they have other than Him, that He might be expressed through
them for the fulfillment of the purpose in His creation of man (Gen. 1:26).

The cross at Golgotha is the place where Satan and his power is defeated.
The victory at Golgotha is still effective today. “Stripping off the rulers and
the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in
it [the cross]” (Col. 2:15). “Through death He might destroy him who has the
might of death, that is, the devil” (Heb. 2:14). Man may consider the Lord
Jesus’ crucifixion as His failure, yet that was the very place of His victory.
In the world, there is no way to determine the victor before the two armies
have engaged one another and fought the battle. The Lord was crucified
on the cross, and He resurrected from the dead. He went into death, fought
with death, overcame the power of death, and then emerged victorious over

everything. It would be impossible to say that the Lord has overcome Satan
if He had not died and resurrected. This is why the Lord had to die—to fight
with Satan, he who has the might of death, and overcome him. The Lord’s
resurrection is the proof of His victory. When Christ was advancing toward
Golgotha, He said, “Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler
of this world be cast out” (John 12:31). Satan was defeated at Golgotha. All
those who want to fight against Satan elsewhere are destined to fail. Other
than at Golgotha, Satan is always victorious. He was defeated only at Golgotha,
and he was defeated at Golgotha forever. Hence, all those who are joined to
the Lamb of Golgotha, who stand on the basis of His victory at Golgotha, not
attempting to gain another new victory but expressing the one unique victory
in the present battle, will overcome. Defeat comes when one trusts in the self,
but victory comes when one stands on the ground of Golgotha. Golgotha is the
place of victory! Golgotha is our home! What can cause us to fear?

We are the Lord’s messengers declaring the victory at Golgotha and
Christ as the Victor. “To whom I send you, …to turn them…from the authority
of Satan to God” (Acts 26:17-18). The victory at Golgotha is still effective
today; Jesus the Savior is still the Victor. Satan is still the defeated one; he
is powerless toward us. Hence, we all must turn away from the authority of
Satan to God.
Christ is the Overcomer. When we are in Christ and are joined to Him, we
will also be the overcomers. We can overcome every day because the Lord
has said, “Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and
scorpions and over all the power of the enemy….The spirits are subject to
you” (Luke 10:19-20). “In My name they will cast out demons” (Mark 16:17;
cf. Acts 16:18; 19:15). Apart from the Lord, we can do nothing. We should
abide in the Lord all the time. If we do everything in the Lord’s name, Satan
will be defeated continually. (CWWN, vol. 1, pp. 100-101)

弗六 12“因我们并不是与血肉之人摔跤，乃是与
那些执政的、掌权的、管辖这黑暗世界的、以
及诸天界里那邪恶的属灵势力摔跤。”

Eph. 6:12 For our wrestling is not against blood and flesh but against the
rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness,
against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.

约壹五 18“…那从神生的，保守自己，那恶者也
就不摸他。”

1 John 5:18 …He who has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the
evil one does not touch him.

提后四 22“愿主与你的灵同在。愿恩典与你们同在。” 2 Tim. 4:22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
魔鬼作工，不仅用法术作手法，也用诡计作谋
略。他的诡计是多端的，我们需要穿戴神全副的
军装，才能抵挡。他能利用我们各种的人事，各
种的遭遇，作他陷害我们的阴谋。他也能从我们
所是、所有、所能、所作、所爱、所好的一切里
面，生出阴谋，来诱骗我们。而他一切的阴谋，
又总是以实遮虚，借善施恶，是我们难以辨认的。
所以我们需要儆醒、祷告，求神时常为我们揭穿
他的阴谋，使我们作一个“并非不晓得他的阴谋”
的人。〔林后二 11。〕（圣经要道，一四七○至
一四七一页。）

信息选读
我们要抵挡魔鬼，就必须穿戴神全副的军装。这
不是单个信徒所能作到的，必须召会才可以。我们
必须同着众圣徒，与魔鬼黑暗的权势争战。以弗所
六章的争战，是召会与魔鬼黑暗权势的争战，所以
以弗所六章的军装，也是召会的军装。我们若活在
召会，就是基督的身体里，同众圣徒穿着这些军装
抵挡魔鬼，就能胜过他，消灭他，而带进神的国度。

The devil uses not only crafty ways in his work but also stratagems. His
stratagems are always varied. We need the whole armor of God to stand
against them. He can use all kinds of persons, things, and matters as his
stratagems to trap us. He can also devise stratagems to deceive us and
distract us from our true status before God, our true obtainments from God,
our true service to God, our true love for God, and our true enjoyment of God.
All his stratagems involve some element of truth being mixed with false and
evil things; therefore, it is difficult to discern and recognize his stratagems.
We need to be watchful and to pray, asking God to expose the devil’s
stratagems so that we would not be ignorant of his stratagems. (CWWL,
1932-1949, vol. 4, “Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Volume 6,” p. 483)

Today’s Reading

In order to stand against the devil, we must put on the whole armor of
God. An individual Christian cannot wear the whole armor of God; it must be
worn by the church. We must fight the devil’s authority of darkness with all
the saints. The warfare in Ephesians 6 is a warfare between the church and
the devil’s authority of darkness; therefore, the armor in Ephesians 6 must
be worn by the church. If we live in the church, the Body of Christ, and put on
the whole armor of God with all the saints in order to stand against the devil,

忘掉老宗教。守晨更不值钱，祷告不值钱。很
可能你的祷告是和撒但合作，你的晨更是给撒但
渗透了，连你作长老都是给撒但作长老。这不是
说你把偶像带到召会来了，也不是说你带着弟兄
犯罪去了；反而你是非常虔诚、殷勤，带着大家
守晨更，努力操练，努力读经。哪知道你这一套
完全在撒但渗透之下。只有一个地方是撒但不能
侵入的，就是你的灵。
愿主怜悯我们每一个人，使我们能看见那从天
上来的异象。并非热心就是好，并非事奉就是好。
大数的扫罗也热心，也事奉神，但他那时是在撒
但的权下；他的事奉神、热心、守律法，都是在
撒但的权下。你敢说你今天热心、守晨更、努力
作这作那，而不在撒但的权下么？到底你是否在
撒但的权下，不是以你所作的事来定，乃是以你
是否在灵里，或是在肉体里来定。有的弟兄五点
半就起来晨更，我要问说，你这个守晨更是你天
然的呢，还是在灵里？若是在天然里，连你的守
晨更都会给撒但利用！但是一在灵里守晨更，那
是另一个味道。
要回到灵中。不是圣洁问题，不是得胜问题，
也不是不犯罪问题，只有一个问题，就是要活在
你的主所在的灵里面。（李常受文集一九七五至

we will overcome him and bring in the kingdom of God. (CWWL, 1932-1949,
vol. 4, “Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Volume 6,” p. 487)

We should forget about old religion. Having morning watch is worthless and
praying is useless if we are not in the spirit. It is possible that our prayers have
been in cooperation with Satan, that our morning watch has been infiltrated
by Satan, and that even our service as an elder has been for Satan. This is not
to say that we have brought idols into the church or have brought the brothers
into sin. On the contrary, we may be very pious and diligent in leading the
saints to have morning watch, to endeavor in this practice, and to endeavor in
reading the Word. However, we may not realize that Satan has infiltrated all
these things. There is only one place that Satan cannot invade—our spirit.
May the Lord be merciful to every one of us and grant us the heavenly
vision. Do not think that merely being zealous and serving God is sufficient.
Saul of Tarsus was also zealous and also served God, yet he was under the
authority of Satan. His service to God, his zeal, and his keeping of the law
were all under Satan’s authority. Can we say that our zeal, our having morning
watch, and our endeavoring in doing many things are not under Satan’s
authority? Whether or not we are under Satan’s authority is not determined
by the things we do. Rather, it is determined by whether we are in the spirit or
in the flesh. Do we have morning watch in our natural being or in our spirit?
If we have morning watch in our natural being, then even though we may rise
at 5:30 A.M., our morning watch can be utilized by Satan. However, if we have
morning watch in the spirit, there will be a different flavor.

We need to turn to our spirit. Being holy, victorious, or freed from sin is
not what matters. The only thing that matters is that we live in the spirit
where the Lord dwells. (CWWL, 1975-1976, vol. 1, “Living in the Spirit,” pp.
473-474)

罗十六 20“平安的神快要将撒但践踏在你们的脚
下。愿我们主耶稣的恩，与你们同在。”

Rom. 16:20 Now the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly.
The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.

十二 5“我们这许多人，在基督里是一个身体，
并且各个互相作肢体，也是如此。”

12:5 So we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually
members one of another.

十六 1“我向你们推荐我们的姊妹非比，她是在
坚革哩的召会的女执事。”

16:1 I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a deaconess of the church
which is in Cenchrea.

罗马十六章二十节的“你们的”在原文是复数，
指基督的身体。神要将撒但践踏在基督身体的脚下。
罗马十六章不是指宇宙的身体，乃是指身体在地方上
实际的彰显。这就是说，撒但只能被践踏在那实际彰
显于众地方召会之基督身体的脚下。我们若在道理上
说到身体，就只有名词而已。唯有当我们有正当的地
方召会，作身体实际的出现，才会将撒但践踏在我们
的脚下。（罗马书生命读经，六二一页。）

The Greek word rendered “your” in Romans 16:20 is plural; this points
to the Body. God will crush Satan under the feet of the Body. Romans 16
does not refer to the Body in a universal sense, but it refers to the local and
practical expression of the Body. This means that Satan can only be crushed
under the feet of the practical expression of the Body in the local churches….
It is only when we have a proper local church as the practical expression of
the Body that Satan is crushed under our feet. (Life-study of Romans, pp.
528-529)

信息选读
我们必须跟随使徒的脚踪；他借着推荐与问安，
将我们带进基督身体全体相调等等生活中，使平安
的神能将撒但践踏在我们脚下，而我们能得享基督
丰富的恩典。（罗十六 1 ～ 16，21 ～ 24，20。）
在罗马十六章，使徒保罗将圣徒一一提名问安，
至少有二十八位圣徒，…并且普遍的问圣徒的安。
这给我们看见，他对每一位圣徒都相当的认识、了
解、关心。这样的推荐和问安，不仅说到众圣徒之
间的关切，也说到众召会之间的交通。因着召会这
样在身体里的交通，就使平安的神能将撒但践踏在
我们脚下，而我们能得享基督丰富的恩典。（经

Today’s Reading

We must follow in the footsteps of the apostle. [Paul] brought us into the
blending life of the entire Body of Christ by recommendations and greetings
in order that the God of peace may crush Satan under our feet and that we
may enjoy the rich grace of Christ (Rom. 16:1-16, 21-24, 20). In Romans 16
the apostle Paul greeted the saints one by one, mentioning at least twentyseven names…. Moreover, he greeted the saints generally. This shows that
he had a considerable amount of knowledge, understanding, and care with
regard to every one of them. Such recommendations and greetings show
both the mutual concern among the saints and the mutual fellowship among
the churches. It is by the churches’ fellowship in the Body that the God of
peace will crush Satan under our feet and we will be able to enjoy the rich

胜过撒但唯一的路，就是留在我们重生之灵的高
台里。…我们一留在灵里，就实际地被建造在身体
里。但我们若留在我们的心思里，就会分裂。不但在
召会生活里是这样，在婚姻生活里也是这样。我若留
在我的心思里，我的妻子也留在她的心思里，我们就
不可能是一。我已经学会对于留在我的心思里有健康

肉体的心思，惧怕由我们异议的思想和意见所引起的
分裂。（见罗八 6。）当我们发觉自己的思想在批评
别人，就需要立刻转向在我们灵里的主，并且祷告。
我们都必须学习转向灵并留在灵里的功课。
在灵里我们不但经历基督作生命，也经历身体。
在灵里基督是我们个人的生命，也是身体的生命。
所以，在灵里，凭着神圣的生命和基督的身体，就
能胜过撒但，甚至将他践踏在我们的脚下。撒但不
是被个人击败，乃是被身体击败。
绝不要忽略你重生的灵，就是你里面的高台，你能
躲避撒但的地方。每当你受试诱要与你的妻子或丈夫
争辩，你就该奔入这高台。婚姻生活里的争辩，都是
发自心思，借着肉体的帮助而来的。每当弟兄对妻子
有消极的思想，肉体就会尽力激动他与妻子争辩。这
指明肉体总是预备好要在消极方面帮助心思。…我们
该逃进我们重生之灵的高台，就是撒但不能摸我们的
地方，也是我们享受基督作我们的生命并经历身体之

grace of Christ. (CWWL, 1994-1997, vol. 5, “The Experience of God’s Organic
Salvation Equaling Reigning in Christ’s Life,” p. 516)

The only way to overcome Satan is to stay in the high tower of our
regenerated spirit. When we stay in the spirit, we are built up in the Body in
a practical way. But if we stay in our minds, we shall be divided. This is true
not only in the church life, but also in married life. If I remain in my mind and
my wife remains in her mind, it will be impossible for us to be one. I have
learned to have a healthy fear of staying in my mind….Whenever I am in the
spirit, there is no problem with oneness. Both in the church life and in our
family life we must be afraid of our minds that are so easily set on the flesh,
afraid of the division caused by our dissenting thoughts and opinions (see
Romans 8:6). When we find ourselves thinking critically of others, we need
to turn immediately to the Lord in our spirit and pray. We all must learn the
lesson of turning to the spirit and staying there.
In the spirit we experience not only Christ as life, but also the Body. In the
spirit Christ is both our life personally and the life of the Body. Therefore, in
the spirit with the divine life and with the Body of Christ, Satan is overcome
and even crushed under our feet. He is defeated not by individuals, but by
the Body.

Never neglect your regenerated spirit, the high tower within you where
you may hide from Satan. Whenever you are tempted to argue with your
wife or husband, you should run into this tower. Arguments in married life
come from the mind assisted by the flesh. Whenever a brother has negative
thoughts about his wife, the flesh will try to provoke him to argue with her.
This indicates that the flesh is always ready to help the mind in a negative
way….We should escape into the high tower of our reborn spirit, the place
where Satan cannot touch us, the place where we enjoy Christ as our life and
experience the reality of the Body. When we are in such a place, Satan can do
nothing to us. (Life-study of Romans, pp. 531-532)

启十二 5“妇人生了一个男孩子，是将来要用铁
杖辖管万国的；她的孩子被提到神和祂的宝座
那里去了。”

Rev. 12:5 And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all
the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to
His throne.

11“弟兄们胜过他，是因羔羊的血，并因自己所
见证的话，他们虽至于死，也不爱自己的魂
生命。”

11 And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because
of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even
unto death.

男孩子被提到天上以后，米迦勒和他的使者就开
始与撒但争战。这指明男孩子，就是神子民中较刚
强的部分，总是从事与神仇敌撒但的争战。得胜者
在地上不断与撒但争战，甚至争战至死，并且把撒
但打败。如今天正等待他们到达那里，好进行争战，
把撒但从天上摔下去。

Immediately after the man-child is raptured to heaven, a war commences
with Michael and his angels against Satan. This indicates that the man-child,
the stronger part of God’s people, is always engaged in fighting God’s enemy,
Satan. The overcomers have been fighting Satan continually, even unto death,
and have defeated him on earth. But heaven is still waiting for them to arrive
there so that a war may be waged to cast Satan out of heaven.

主已把击败仇敌最有效的方法指示了我们。我们
所要作的，就是取用神的约，就是神的话，将主为
我们所作成的，向撒但传讲。比方说，已过每逢我
们受自己的脾气困扰时，都是先向主认罪，求主赦
免，然后再祷告求主帮助，最后立定心志不再发脾
气。这样的事不知重复了多少次。但我们不该再这
样。每当我们的脾气又要发作时，先不要管脾气，
要向撒但传讲。我们要到问题的源头，就是撒但面
前，向他传讲说，“撒但，你已经被钉在十字架上
了。”你越向撒但传讲，你就越得释放。（启示录

The Lord has shown us the most effective way to defeat the enemy. What
we need to do is to take the covenant, the word of God, and preach to Satan
regarding what the Lord has accomplished for us. For example, whenever we
were troubled by our temper in the past, we firstly confessed it, then asked
the Lord for forgiveness, prayed to the Lord to help us, and finally made up
our mind never to lose our temper again. I experienced this many times.
But we should not do this anymore. When our temper is aroused, we should
forget it and preach to Satan. Go to the source of the problem—Satan—and
preach to him, saying, “Satan, you have been crucified on the cross.” The more
you preach to Satan, the more you will be released. (Life-study of Revelation,
p. 450)

在地上对你讲的信息么？”…然后，男孩子会说，
“撒但，你不应该再在这里，出去！”男孩子一宣
布这话，天使长米迦勒就率领他的使者与龙争战。
执行官一发命令，所有的警察就出来执行这命令。
神在诸天之上正等待着这个执行者。谁是执行者？
就是我们这班男孩子！盼望我们都到那里去向撒但
传讲。但要在那里作这事，我们必须先在地上打败
撒但。在地上打败撒但后，我们要争战到天上，至
终还要从天上争战到地上。现在当我们面对撒但时，
就要向他讲许多信息；以后到了天上遇见他时，还
要再向他传讲。等到撒但被摔到地上破坏地的时候，
我们还要下来对他说，“撒但，你还在这里么？我
再向你讲一篇道，现在就是你下无底坑的时候了。”
然后，千年国以后，要再向撒但讲第四篇道。那时，
撒但要煽动人起来背叛神，而我们就要说，“撒但，
听我们说！这是我们的最后一篇道，现在你要到你
命定的地方—火湖—去。”
你若想够格有分于这事，现在就必须争战。不要
无所谓。我盼望你读完这篇信息以后，能强有力地
向仇敌说，“撒但，你欺骗我多年，现在我〔的〕…
眼睛已被开启，不能再无所谓了。撒但，你不仅是
神的仇敌，也是我的仇敌。从今以后，我要绝对地
为着主，再也不听你的话了。”…你若这样对撒但
传讲，就会变成另一个人，并且很可能不久就包括
在那妇人较刚强的部分里。从现在开始，我们都要
够 资 格， 装 备 好， 被 成 全， 在 那 些 被 提 到 天 上，

五二四至五二五页。）

the heavens? Now I have come here to preach to you! Don’t you remember
the messages I gave you on earth?”….Then the man-child will say, “Satan,
you should no longer be here! Get out!” As soon as this word is uttered by
the man-child, Michael the archangel will lead all his angels to war against
the dragon. After the executor gives the word, all the policemen will come
to carry it out. God is waiting in the heavens for this executor. Who will be
the executor? We, the man-child. Let us go there to preach to Satan. Before
we can do this, however, we must first defeat him on earth. After defeating
Satan on earth, we shall fight upward to heaven, and eventually we shall
fight downward to earth. Now as we confront Satan, we must give him many
messages. Later we shall go to the heavens, meet him there, and preach
to him again. Then after he has been cast down to earth to damage it, we
shall descend and say to him, “Satan, are you still here? Let me give you
another sermon. Now is the time for you to go to the abyss.” Then after the
millennium there will be the fourth sermon given to Satan. At that time,
Satan will instigate mankind to rebel against God. But we shall say, “Satan,
listen to us. This is our last sermon. Now you must go to your destination—
the lake of fire.”
If you would be qualified to participate in this, you must fight now. Do not
be indifferent. I hope that after you read this message you will give a strong
word to the enemy, saying, “Satan, you have deceived me for years. But by
reading these messages my eyes have been opened and I see that I must no
longer be indifferent. Satan, you are not only God’s enemy—you are also my
enemy. From now on, I will be absolute for my Lord and I will never listen
to you.”… If you preach to Satan like this, you will become another person
and will probably soon be included in the stronger part of the woman.
Begin now to be qualified, equipped, and perfected to be among those who
will be raptured to heaven to execute judgment upon Satan. (Life-study of
Revelation, pp. 450-451)

2. For the Body is God’s armor,
Not for anyone alone;
When you wrestle in the Body,
All its benefits you own.

5. As a member of the Body,
With the brethren stand for God;
Praying always in the Spirit,
Claim the vict’ry through the Blood.

3. ’Tis the Church on Christ established
Satan shall not overpow’r;
’Tis the Body built together
Which resists the evil pow’r.

6. In the heav’nlies more than conqu’ror,
In the power of His might,
As a soldier in the army,
In the Lord the battle fight.

4. In the Body, by the Headship,
Sitting in the heavenlies,
Struggle with the wicked spirits
And the principalities.

7. Keep on wrestling in the Body,
Mighty vict’ry you will see,
Bind and loose, God’s will fulfilling,
And the foes your food will be.

Outline
§Day 1

壹 约伯受搅扰、困惑、迷惑到了极点，因为 I. Job was disturbed, perplexed, and entangled to the uttermost
by his suffering of the disasters that befell his possessions
他虽然完全、正直且纯全，却有灾祸临到
and his children and the plague on his body, in spite of his
他的家产和儿女，且有灾病临到他的身体：
perfection, uprightness, and integrity:
一 约伯咒诅自己的生日（即咒诅自己的母亲）时，
必然不是完全、正直的，也没有持守他的纯全，
反而在他的纯正上破产了—伯三 1。
二 神的目的是要拆毁那在自己的完全和正直里天然
的约伯，使祂能建立一个有神的性情和属性，得
更新的约伯，好使约伯成为属神的人，按着神的
经纶由神所构成；这样的人（如保罗）绝不会受
任何难处和问题所困惑，以致咒诅自己的生日，
宁愿死不愿活—腓一 19 ～ 25，四 5 ～ 9。

A. When Job cursed the day of his birth, equivalent to cursing his mother,
he surely was not perfect and upright, nor did he hold his integrity;
rather, he became bankrupt in integrity—Job 3:1.

B. God’s intention was to tear down the natural Job in his perfection and
uprightness that He might build up a renewed Job in God’s nature
and attributes in order to make Job a man of God, constituted with
God according to His economy; such a man (like Paul) would never be
entangled by any troubles and problems so that he would curse his
birth and prefer to die rather than to live—Phil. 1:19-25; 4:5-9.

三 约伯沉缅于他美好的过去，为他悲惨的现况叹
息，（伯二九 1 ～三十 31，）并且坚持，甚至
夸耀他的正直、公义、纯全与完全（二七 1 ～ 7，
三一 1 ～ 40）：
1 然而，保罗却操练忘记背后已过的事，好赢得
目前“今天的基督”到最完满的地步—腓三 8，
13 ～ 14。
2 不仅如此，保罗不是昨天的人，乃是今天的人；（来
三 7 ～ 8，14，诗九五 7 ～ 8；）我们不该往前看将来，
也不该回顾已往；我们乃是今天的人。（太六 11，
33 ～ 34，路十九 9 ～ 10，二三 43。）
3 我们所爱的基督乃是现在的基督、今日的基督，也
是在诸天之上、宝座上的基督，作我们每天的救恩
并时刻的供应，支持我们在地上过属天的生活—太
二八 20，彼前一 8，来八 2，四 14 ～ 15，七 26，林
后六 2，罗五 10。
4 当我们完全成为新耶路撒冷时，我们所有的乃是今
天，因为永世里的每一天都是今天；我们唯一拥有
的日子是今天，不是明天。

【周二】
四 约伯借着八次对他三个朋友的讲话，暴露了自
己是有以下特征的人：
1 约 伯 是 自 义 的；（ 伯 六 30， 九 20， 二 七 5 ～ 6，
三二 1；）他因自己天然人的成功和成就而昏暗，
满意于自己所成为的，却不知道自己在神面前可怜
的光景。（参腓三 9，启三 17 ～ 18。）
2 约伯只是在名义上承认神，却不是在实际里；他没有
被神浸透，被神充满，也没有与神调和而与神成为

C. Job was dwelling on his excellent past and sighing over his miserable
present (Job 29:1—30:31); he held fast insistently to, and even
boasted of, his uprightness, righteousness, integrity, and perfection
(27:1-7; 31:1-40):

1. Paul, however, exercised to forget the things that were behind in the past
in order to gain the present “today Christ” to the fullest extent—Phil. 3:8,
13-14.
2. Furthermore, Paul was not a person of yesterday but a person of today
(Heb. 3:7-8, 15; Psa. 95:7-8); we should not look ahead to the future and
not look back to the past; we are people of today (Matt. 6:11, 33-34; Luke
19:9-10; 23:43).
3. The Christ whom we love is the Christ now, the Christ today, and the
Christ on the throne in the heavens, who is our daily salvation and
moment-by-moment supply, sustaining us to live a heavenly life on
earth—Matt. 28:20; 1 Pet. 1:8; Heb. 8:2; 4:14-15; 7:26; 2 Cor. 6:2; Rom.
5:10.
4. When we fully become the New Jerusalem, we will have today since every
day in eternity is today; the only day we have is today, not tomorrow.

§Day 2

D. Through his eight times of speaking to his three friends, Job exposed
himself as a person with the following characteristics:

1. Job was self-righteous (Job 6:30; 9:20; 27:5-6; 32:1); he was darkened by
the success and attainments of his natural being, contented with what he
had become, yet he was unaware of his miserable situation before God (cf.
Phil. 3:9; Rev. 3:17-18).
2. Job acknowledged God in name but not in reality; he was not saturated
by God, filled with God, and mingled with God to become one with God—

3 约伯没有得着那作神的生机体、以活神并彰显神直
到永远之新耶路撒冷某些方面和某些特征的任何元
素；反之，神的名，新耶路撒冷的名，并主的新名，
写在得胜者上面，指明神的所是、新耶路撒冷的性
质、以及主的人位，都已作到得胜者里面—启三
12。

五 约伯和他的朋友们都不知道神对付约伯的目的，
如使徒保罗向新约信徒所宣告的：信徒所受的
苦楚是要为他们成就永远重大的荣耀，就是荣
耀的神作他们荣耀的分，给他们得着并享受，
直到永远—林后四 17。

【周三】
六 约伯和他的朋友们若花时间在谦卑的灵里寻求
神，并在祷告里操练他们的灵，（赛五七 15，
六六 2，西四 2，）神就可能给他们看见在基督
里得重生、变化并荣化的圣徒，与天然的人无
分无关，也不需要用天然人的美德建立自己。
七 这属天的异象就会拯救他们，免去他们在约伯
记三十五章经文里浪费时间、加添痛苦、并虚
空的辩论；这些经文乃是一群瞎眼的人在黑暗
中摸索的记载；他们谈论神，也说到他们的灵，
（三二 8，）但在他们三回长篇的辩论中，他们
运用他们的心思，而没有运用灵为约伯祷告并
彼此交通，好叫他们都能摸着神，得着神作他
们的生命、光和属灵的供应：
1 我们若要有活力排，就必须以约伯记里这些人的谈论
为警戒；我们在约伯记中所看见的排聚会，提供我们

26; Heb. 2:10-11.

3. Job did not possess any element that indicated some aspect and some
feature of the New Jerusalem as God’s organism to live God and to express
God for eternity; in contrast to this, the name of God, the name of the New
Jerusalem, and the name of the Lord are written upon the overcomer,
indicating that what God is, the nature of the New Jerusalem, and the
person of the Lord have all been wrought into the overcomer—Rev. 3:12.

E. Neither Job nor his friends knew the purpose of God’s dealing with
him, as the apostle Paul did in declaring to the New Testament
believers that the affliction the believers are suffering works out for
them an eternal weight of glory, which is the God of glory to be their
glorious portion for them to gain and enjoy unto eternity—2 Cor. 4:17.

§Day 3

F. If Job and his friends had taken the time to seek God in a spirit of
humility and by exercising their spirit in prayer (Isa. 57:15; 66:2; Col.
4:2), God could have shown them that a regenerated, transformed,
and glorified saint in Christ has nothing to do with the natural man
and does not need to build up himself with the natural virtues.

G. This heavenly vision would have saved them from the time- wasting,
pain-increasing, and vain debates in thirty-five chapters as a record
of a group of blind persons groping in darkness; they talked about
God and also referred to their spirit (Job 32:8), but they exercised
their mind in three rounds of long debates instead of exercising
their spirit to pray for Job and to fellowship with one another so that
all of them could touch God and receive God as their life, light, and
spiritual supply:
1. If we are going to have vital groups, we must be warned by these talks in
the book of Job; the group we see in the book of Job affords us a negative

操练我们的灵祷告；活力排就是活力祷告的排—参徒

2 活力排的活力在于这二灵：在于人的灵并在于神的

3 我们要学习在我们的灵里接触神的灵；这是基督徒

【周四】

example; it is the kind of group meeting we should not have in the church
life today; the first thing that we must do when we come together is to
exercise our spirit to pray; the vital groups are groups of vital prayer—cf.
Acts 12:5, 11-12; Heb. 10:24-25; 3:13.

2. The groups are vital in these two spirits—vital in our human spirit and
vital in God’s divine Spirit; the Christian life is a life of the consummated
Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God dwelling in and mingled
with our regenerated spirit to be one spirit—John 4:24; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor.
6:17; Gal. 3:14; 6:18.

3. We need to learn to touch the divine Spirit in our spirit; this is the
intrinsic significance of the Christian life and work; this is the move of
God in man and the move of man in God to fulfill His economy, His plan,
to dispense Himself in Christ as the Spirit into man in order to build up
His Body and prepare His bride to consummate the New Jerusalem—2
Cor. 2:13; Phil. 3:3; Rom. 1:9.

4. Paul stresses in the book of Romans that whatever we are (2:29; 8:5-6, 9),
whatever we have (vv. 10, 16), and whatever we do toward God (1:9; 7:6;
8:4; 12:11) must be in our spirit; we must be perfected and built up to be
persons in the spirit; there is no other way to be a lover of God, to be a
seeker of Christ, or to be an overcomer than to be in the spirit (Rev. 1:10;
4:2; 17:3; 21:10).

全的总和—我们天然性格上的完全和正直—腓
一 19 ～ 20，三 4 ～ 9 上。
二 天天时时，约伯一直被销毁，他并不喜乐，但
在新约里，神的销毁和剥夺成为可喜悦的事；
自保罗信主那天起，他就是一个在神的销毁和
剥夺之下主里的囚犯，但他满了喜乐和欢乐—
徒九 15 ～ 16，林后四 16，腓一 19 ～ 21 上，
弗 三 1， 四 1， 腓 一 4，18，25， 二 2，17 ～
18，28 ～ 29，三 1，四 1，4。
三 保罗已经与基督同钉十字架；借着了结和新生的起
头而再生，就是重生时就钉了十字架；（约三 5，
罗六 4，西二 12；）我们就象保罗一样，在重生时
已经被钉十字架，目的是从那时起，不再是我们活
着，乃是基督在我们里面活着。（加二 20。）
四 现今我们基督徒的生活是借死而活；（20，林
前十五 31，36，约十二 24，林后四 11；）借死
而活乃是背十字架的正确意义。（太十六 24 ～
26，诗歌四六一首。）

【周五】
五 保罗在经历神的销毁和剥夺时，四面受压，却
不被困住；打倒了，却不至灭亡；保罗没有咒
诅自己的生日，也没有说宁愿死，不愿生；相
反的，经过许多考量后，保罗说，他宁愿活着，
为使圣徒得到信仰上的进步（他们生命的长大）
和喜乐（他们对基督的享受）—林后一 8 ～ 9，
加二 20，腓一 21 ～ 25。
六 当 保 罗 为 基 督 的 缘 故 受 困 苦 时，（ 林 后 十 二
10，）他是喜悦快乐的，甚至为着他的经历而
在主里喜乐。（西一 24，腓二 17 ～ 18。）
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 3 周纲要 - 第 5 页

perfection and uprightness in our character—that replaces our living
out Christ to express Christ—Phil. 1:19-20; 3:4-9a.

B. Day by day and hour by hour, Job was unhappily being consumed,
but in the New Testament, God’s consuming and stripping become
pleasant things; since the day he was converted, Paul was a person
under God’s consuming and stripping as a prisoner in the Lord,
but he was filled with joy and rejoicing—Acts 9:15-16; 2 Cor. 4:16;
Phil. 1:19-21a; Eph. 3:1; 4:1; Phil. 1:4, 18, 25; 2:2, 17-18, 28-29; 3:1;
4:1, 4.
C. Paul was crucified with Christ; to be reborn through termination and
germination is to be regenerated crucified (John 3:5; Rom. 6:4; Col.
2:12); we, like Paul, were reborn crucified for the purpose that from
that time it would be no longer we who live but Christ who lives in us
(Gal. 2:20).
D. Now in our Christian life we are dying to live (v. 20; 1 Cor. 15:31,
36; John 12:24; 2 Cor. 4:11); dying to live is the proper meaning of
bearing the cross (Matt. 16:24-26; Hymns, #622).

§Day 5

E. In his experience of God’s consuming and stripping, Paul was not
constricted under the pressures on every side and did not perish
despite his being cast down; Paul did not curse the day of his birth,
and he did not say that he preferred to die rather than to live; on the
contrary, after much consideration Paul said that he still preferred to
live for the saints’ progress (their growth in life) and for their joy of the
faith (their enjoyment of Christ)—2 Cor. 1:8-9; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:21-25.
F. When Paul was suffering distresses for the sake of Christ (2 Cor.
12:10), he was well pleased, he was happy, and he was even rejoicing
in the Lord for his experiences (Col. 1:24; Phil. 2:17-18).

受苦的交通，好模成基督的死；（三 10；）他
以基督的死作他生活的模子，模成基督的死是
他极大的喜悦。
八 保罗借着耶稣基督之灵全备的供应，无论是生，
是死，都借着活基督而显大基督；当神造人时，
祂要人过的就是这种生活—一 19 ～ 21 上，创
一 26。
九 保罗说，他身体上常带着耶稣的治死，杀死，
常为耶稣被交于死，使耶稣的生命，在他那必
死的肉身上显明出来；当我们在主死的杀死之
下，祂复活的生命就借着我们分赐到别人里面—
林后四 10 ～ 12：
1 在我们环境里耶稣的治死，与内住的灵合作，杀死
我们天然的人（我们外面的人），包括我们的身体
和魂；我们外面的人因着死的杀死工作而渐渐销毁，
我们里面的人却因着复活生命新鲜的供应而日日在
更新—16 节。
2 保罗说他是天天死；（林前十五 31；）他天天冒死、
面对死，并向自己死。（林后十一 23，四 11，一 8 ～
9，罗八 36。）
3 基督之死及其功效的应用是在于复合的灵，这灵住
在我们灵里，分赐基督的死及其功效，从我们的
灵到我们的魂，甚至到我们必死的身体里—出三十
22 ～ 25，罗八 6，9 ～ 11。
4 这分赐就是膏油的涂抹，（约壹二 20，27，）而膏
油的涂抹就是内住之灵的运行；我们的祷告使内住
之灵的运行发动，而在这运行之内有杀死的能力。

G. Paul wanted to know Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the
fellowship of His sufferings in order to be conformed to Christ’s death
(3:10); he took Christ’s death as a mold for his life, and it was his great
pleasure to be molded in the death of Christ.
H.Paul magnified Christ by living Him, whether through life or through
death, by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ; when God
created man, this was the kind of life He wanted man to live—1:1921a; Gen. 1:26.
I. Paul said that he was always bearing about in the body the putting to
death, the killing, of Jesus and being delivered unto death for Jesus’
sake that the life of Jesus might be manifested in his mortal flesh;
when we are under the killing of the Lord’s death, His resurrection life
is imparted through us into others—2 Cor. 4:10-12:
1. The putting to death of Jesus in our environment cooperates with the
indwelling Spirit to kill our natural man (our outer man), comprising our
body and our soul; as our outer man is being consumed by the killing
work of death, our inner man is being renewed day by day with the fresh
supply of the resurrection life—v. 16.
2. Paul said that he died daily (1 Cor. 15:31); daily he risked death, faced
death, and died to self (2 Cor. 11:23; 4:11; 1:8-9; Rom. 8:36).

3. The application of Christ’s death and its effectiveness is in the
compounded Spirit, who dwells in our spirit to dispense Christ’s death
and its effectiveness from our spirit to our soul and even to our mortal
body—Exo. 30:22-25; Rom. 8:6, 9-11.
4. This dispensing is the anointing (1 John 2:20, 27), and the anointing is
the moving of the indwelling Spirit; our prayer activates the moving of
the indwelling Spirit, and within this moving, there is the killing power.

十 保罗在经历神的销毁和剥夺时，他说我们那短
暂轻微的苦楚，要极尽超越地为我们成就永远
重大的荣耀；“永远”与“短暂”相对，“重大”
与“轻微”相对，“荣耀”与“苦楚”相对—
林后四 16 ～ 17，罗八 28 ～ 29。
十一 约伯认为他所受的苦楚非常沉重，但保罗认为
他的苦楚是短暂轻微的；我们不需要在意我们的
苦楚，倒需要关切我们被变化，从一种程度的荣
耀到另一种程度的荣耀，借此神这重大的荣耀就
在我们里面加增；只要我们更多得着神，这才是
真正重要的事—徒七 2，林后三 18，西二 19：
1 我们就象保罗一样，是在受苦和受压的环境之下，
这环境与那灵一同作工，杀死我们天然的人；我
们应当在我们的灵、魂、体里与内住的灵合作，并
接受外面的环境；因为我们不是顾念所见暂时苦楚
的事，乃是顾念所不见永远荣耀的事—腓一 19 ～
20，林后四 18，来十一 1，27，林后五 7。
2 我们需要操练我们的灵，而在杀死的环境中喜乐；
（腓四 4；）主的主宰权柄在运行，将我们放在基
督之死的杀死下，使祂的生命能显明在我们的身体
上，以更新我们里面的人，使我们象新耶路撒冷一
样的新。（林后四 10 ～ 12，16，五 17，加六 15，

§Day 6

J. In his experience of God’s consuming and stripping, Paul said that
our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and
more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory; eternal is in contrast to
momentary, weight is in contrast to lightness, and glory is in contrast
to affliction—2 Cor. 4:16-17; Rom. 8:28-29.
K. Job considered his suffering of affliction something very heavy, but
Paul considered his affliction to be momentary and light; instead of
caring about our affliction, we need to care for the increase of God
as the weight of glory within us by our being transformed from one
degree of glory to another; as long as we have more of God in us, this
is what really matters—Acts 7:2; 2 Cor. 3:18; Col. 2:19:

1. Like Paul, we are in an environment of suffering and pressure that works
with the Spirit to kill our natural man; we should cooperate with the
indwelling Spirit and accept the outward environment in our spirit, soul,
and body, because we do not regard the things of temporary affliction
which are seen but the things of the eternal glory which are not seen—
Phil. 1:19-20; 2 Cor. 4:18; Heb. 11:1, 27; 2 Cor. 5:7.
2. We need to exercise our spirit to rejoice in the midst of our killing

and to die is gain.

他不愿失去自己的完全，就借着咒诅自己的生日发

In Job chapter 3 Job cursed the day of his birth. He was a good man and
he was trying to keep his perfection, uprightness, and integrity, but due
to his vexation he could not contain himself, and he did not know what to
do. No doubt, he expected to have a time to deal with God, but this was not
something that he dared to initiate. Not wanting to lose his perfection, he
released his vexation by cursing his birthday.

Job was disturbed, perplexed, and entangled to the uttermost by his
suffering of the disasters that befell his possessions and his children and
the plague on his body, in spite of his perfection, uprightness, and integrity.
When Job cursed his birthday, he surely was not perfect and upright. In doing
this… he became bankrupt in integrity….To curse his birthday meant that he
cursed his mother. (Life-study of Job, p. 25)

Today’s Reading

Job indicated that he preferred death instead of life (Job 3:11-23). It is
difficult to believe that Job actually preferred death instead of life…. Perhaps
Job did not [put an end to himself] because he wanted to keep his integrity.
Job’s experience of God’s consuming and stripping in the Old Testament
was far behind that of Paul in the New Testament. God’s consuming is to
exhaust us, and God’s stripping is to take away our riches from us. First, God
stripped Job of his possessions, and then God consumed him. Job’s suffering

新约里，神的销毁和剥夺成为可喜悦的事。自保罗
信主那天起，他就是一个在神的销毁和神的剥夺之

乃是基督在我们里面活着。
保罗在经历神的销毁和剥夺时，四面受压，却不
被困住；打倒了，却不至灭亡。（林后四 8 ～ 9。）…
保罗…每天都被打倒，他却不至灭亡。保罗没有咒
诅自己的生日，也没有说宁愿死，不愿生。相反地，
经过许多考量后，保罗说，他宁愿活着，不愿离世，
因为在他活着就是基督。（腓一 21 ～ 25。）保罗活
基督，乃是为着显大基督。他渴望无论是生，是死，
都显大基督。（20。）
当保罗为基督的缘故受困苦时，他是喜悦快乐
的，（林后十二 10，）甚至为着他的经历而在主里
喜乐。（西一 24。）保罗对受苦的反应与约伯极为
不同。约伯没有喜乐，乃是一直烦恼。
保罗追求在同基督受苦的交通中，模成祂的死。
（腓三 10。）他以基督的死作他生活的模子。对保
罗而言，模成基督的死是极大的喜悦。
保罗说，他身体上常带着耶稣的治死，常为耶稣
被交于死，使耶稣的生命，在他那必死的肉身上显明

of the plague on his body was a consuming. Day by day and hour by hour, Job
was being consumed. In the New Testament God’s consuming and stripping
become pleasant things. Since the day he was converted, Paul was a person
under God’s consuming and God’s stripping (2 Cor. 4:16).

Paul was born destined to be crucified, and he was reborn crucified that
it would be no longer he who lived but Christ who lived in him (Gal. 2:20a).
When we were regenerated, we, like Paul, were reborn crucified for the
purpose that from that time it would be no longer we who live but Christ
who lives in us.

In his experience of God’s consuming and stripping, Paul was not
constricted under the pressures on every side and did not perish despite
his being cast down (2 Cor. 4:8-9)…. Every day he was cast down, but he did
not perish. Paul did not curse the day of his birth, and he did not say that he
preferred to die rather than to live. On the contrary, after much consideration
Paul said that he still preferred to live, not to die, because to him to live was
Christ (Phil. 1:21-25). Paul’s living Christ was for him to magnify Christ. His
desire was to magnify Christ whether through life or through death (v. 20).
When Paul was suffering distresses for the sake of Christ (2 Cor. 12:10), he
was well pleased, he was happy, and he was even rejoicing in the Lord for his
experiences (Col. 1:24). Paul’s reaction to his sufferings was very different
from Job’s. Job did not rejoice but was all the time vexed.

Paul pursued to be conformed to Christ’s death in the fellowship of His
sufferings (Phil. 3:10). He took Christ’s death as a mold for his life. To Paul it
was a great pleasure to be molded in the death of Christ.

Paul said that he was always bearing about in the body the putting to death
of Jesus and was always being delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake that the life
of Jesus might be manifested in his mortal flesh (2 Cor. 4:10-11). Every day
in his Christian life Paul was put to death. The only way for him to manifest
Christ’s life was to experience Christ’s death. (Life-study of Job, pp. 26-28)

share in the coming ages. We will all share the Lord’s glory, but the weight of
glory will differ among the believers. Through God’s consuming, the glory that
we will share will become an eternal weight. Job considered his suffering of
affliction something very heavy, but Paul considered his affliction momentary
and light. Instead of caring about our affliction, we need to care for the increase
of the weight of glory. How much weight of glory we will have depends on how
much we suffer in our present affliction for the Lord’s sake. Paul…knew that
the more he suffered, the more weight of glory he would share in eternity.

Paul magnified Christ by living Him, whether through life or through
death, by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19-21a).
This is the Christian life. When God created man, this is the kind of life He
wanted man to live.

God’s intention with Job was to consume this “perfect and upright” person
and to strip his attainments, his achievements, in the highest standard of
ethics in perfection and uprightness (Job 1:1). God’s intention was also to
tear down the natural Job in his perfection and uprightness that He might
build up a renewed Job in God’s nature and attributes. Eventually, God’s
intention was to make Job a man of God (1 Tim. 6:11; 2 Tim. 3:17), filled with
Christ, the embodiment of God, to be the fullness of God for the expression
of God in Christ, not a man of the high standard of ethics in Job’s natural
perfection, natural uprightness, and natural integrity…. Such a person,
constituted with God according to His economy, would never be entangled by
any troubles and problems so that he would curse his birth and prefer to die
rather than to live. (Life-study of Job, pp. 28-29)
In [Hebrews Christ] is the present Christ, who is now in the heavens as
our Minister (Heb. 8:2) and our High Priest (4:14-15; 7:26), ministering to
us the heavenly life, grace, authority, and power and sustaining us to live a
heavenly life on earth. He is the Christ now, the Christ today, and the Christ
on the throne in the heavens, who is our daily salvation and moment-bymoment supply. (Heb. 1:3, footnote 4)

pick up some new terms and new expressions. You can do this because you
have the Triune God as the consummated Spirit in your spirit.

The groups are vital in these two spirits…. Acts through Revelation [cover]
the matter of the divine Spirit who is now in our spirit to become one spirit
(1 Cor. 6:17)….God moves in man and man moves in God in these two spirits.
Therefore, when you come to the vital groups, you should turn to the spirit,
remain in the spirit, and exercise the spirit.
Do not come to the vital groups to talk naturally yet quite intimately. That
kills the groups. Instead, exercise your spirit to praise God or to sing a stanza
or a few lines of a hymn. This kind of praising and singing stirs up the spirits
of those in the vital group. Then everyone will follow to pray.

After…prayer, we should fellowship…in our spirit by exercising our spirit.
Our speaking concerning a saint who is sick should not be in ordinary words
but in words from the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit….Try to bring the group
into the two spirits. This will make a great difference, and…will help to lay
the foundation for the vital group to move in the two spirits. Furthermore,
when you visit others, at your home, in their home, or in the meeting hall,
exercise your spirit.
Learn to touch the divine Spirit in your spirit. This is the Christian life, and
this should also be the Christian work. This is the move of God in man and
the move of man in God to fulfill God’s economy, His plan concerning Christ
with His Body. We are here on earth for this, and for this we should live by
the two spirits, follow the two spirits, and do everything according to the two
spirits.
The way to be such a person is very simple—the way is to be in our
spirit….We all need to learn of John to be in our spirit [cf. Rev. 1:10, 12] to see

When we were regenerated, we were crucified….No one was born
crucified in a physical sense, but every believer is regenerated crucified. This
corresponds with the Lord’s word in John 3:5: “Unless one is born of water
and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”…The water refers to
John’s ministry, and the Spirit refers to the Lord’s ministry.

To be born of water, according to John’s ministry, is for the termination
of people of the old creation. When we are buried in the water of John’s
ministry, this indicates that we realize that we are good for nothing but
death. When people came to John to repent, John threw them into the water
to bury them, to end them, to terminate them. When a sinner repents to God,
he should repent to such an extent that he realizes he is good for nothing
but death. Thus, he hands himself over like a corpse to the baptizer. (CWWL,

我们是重生时就已钉十字架的，也是借死而活的。
（林前十五 36。）我们生来就是死的，现在我们乃是
借死而活。“借死而活”的意思乃是，在基督的钉十字
架之下活着。每一天我们都是在死，保罗说他是天天
死。（31，林后四 11。）我们的环境天天都将我们治死。
我们的死乃是一件继续不断的事。基督徒的生活是长久
受死的生活。每一天我们都借死而活。我们重生时就被
钉了十字架，现今我们是借死而活。这就是在基督钉十
字架下的生活。…在加拉太二章二十节，…一面，保罗
已经被了结了；但另一面，复活的保罗，也就是得了重
生的保罗，仍然活着。保罗已经与基督同钉十字架，但
基督活在他里面，他也活基督。（腓一 21 上。）基督
和保罗同有一个生命，和一个生活。

We are regenerated crucified and are dying to live (1 Cor. 15:36). We were
born dead, and now we are dying to live. Dying to live means to live under the
crucifixion of Christ. Every day we are dying. Paul says that he died daily (v.
31; 2 Cor. 4:11). Our environment is putting us to death every day. Our dying
is a continuous matter. The Christian life is a long life of dying. Every day we
die to live. We were reborn crucified, and now we are dying to live. This is a
living under the crucifixion of Christ. In Galatians 2:20…, on the one hand,
Paul had been terminated, but on the other hand, a resurrected Paul, one
who had been regenerated, still lived. Paul had been crucified with Christ, yet
Christ lived in him and he lived Christ (Phil. 1:21a). Christ and Paul had one
life and one living.

我们现在要再来看一次，谁死在十字架上。我们必须
说，“我死在十字架上。”当基督成为肉体时，祂将我
们穿在祂自己身上。祂穿上了血肉之体。（来二 14。）
所以，当祂被钉十字架时，我们也与祂同钉十字架。我
们都是基督的一部分，接受了祂在十字架上之死的注射。

Now we need to consider once more who died on the cross. We need
to say, “I died on the cross.” When Christ was incarnated, He took us upon
Himself. He put on blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14). Therefore, when He was
crucified, we were crucified with Him. All of us as a part of Christ, received
the injection of His death on the cross.

在“重生时就已钉十字架，并借死而活”这句话里，
“并”这个连接词将“重生”以及“死”连接在一起。
我们是重生的，我们也一直在死。我们已经重生而钉了
十字架，现今我们必须死，使我们可以活着。在我们受
浸之后，我们是借死而活着。借死而活是背十字架的正
确意义。（基督徒的生活，一六九至一七一、一七四页。）

In the phrase regenerated crucified and dying to live the conjunction
and conjoins regenerated and dying. We are regenerated, and we are dying.
We have been regenerated crucified, and now we need to die that we may
live. After our baptism, we live by dying and we die to live. Dying to live is
the proper meaning of bearing the cross. (CWWL, 1991-1992, vol. 2, “The

林后四 11 ～ 12“因为我们这活着的人，是常为
耶稣被交于死，使耶稣的生命，也在我们这必
死的肉身上显明出来。这样，死是在我们身上
发动，生命却在你们身上发动。”

2 Cor. 4:11-12 For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death
for Jesus’ sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our
mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you.

在我们环境里耶稣的治死，与内住的灵合作，杀
死我们天然的人（我们外面的人），包括我们的身
体和魂。这是林后四章十至十二节里着重说到的。
保罗说他身体上常带着耶稣的治死，使耶稣的生命
也显明在他的身体上。…十六节说，“我们外面的
人虽然在毁坏，我们里面的人却日日在更新。”“毁
坏”的意思是销毁、消耗、磨损。我们外面的人因
着死的杀死工作而渐渐销毁，我们里面的人却因着
复活生命新鲜的供应而渐渐更新。（基督徒的生活，
一三○至一三二页。）

The putting to death of Jesus in our environment cooperates with the
indwelling Spirit to kill our natural man (our outer man), comprising our
body and our soul. This is mentioned emphatically in 2 Corinthians 4:10-12.
Paul says that he was bearing about in his body the putting to death of Jesus
that the life of Jesus might be manifested in his body. Second Corinthians 4:16
says, “Our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by
day.” The word decaying means “being consumed, being wasted away, being
worn out.”… As our outer man is being consumed by the killing work of death,
our inner man is being renewed with the fresh supply of the resurrection life.
(CWWL, 1991-1992, vol. 2, “The Christian Life,” pp. 438-439)

Today’s Reading

We all like to have a nice environment, with everything smooth, peaceful,
sweet, and nice…. [Instead], we are under an environment of sufferings and
pressures that works with the Spirit to kill our natural man. Brother Nee referred
to this kind of environment as the discipline of the Holy Spirit…. In speaking
about the application of Christ’s death, Romans 8 refers to the indwelling Spirit,
and 2 Corinthians 4 refers to the outward environment. The outward environment
cooperates with the inward Spirit to carry out the killing of our natural man.

Second Corinthians 4:10 indicates that the death of Christ kills us.
The apostle Paul always was under the killing of Christ’s death…. He
was continually under the persecution of the Jews, the Gentiles, and the
Judaizers…. Daily he risked death, faced death, and died to self (2 Cor. 11:23;
4:11; 1:8-9; Rom. 8:36). He was bearing about in his body the killing of Jesus

使耶稣的生命能在他身上显明出来。
用以复合那灵的基督之死及其功效，在那灵里成
为有效的。基督的死若不是在那灵里，祂的死就无
法发生功效。我们若享受并经历那灵，祂的死就在
我们里面发生功效。基督的死乃是在那灵里。
这经过复合的灵住在我们的灵里，分赐基督的死
及其功效，从我们的灵到我们的魂，甚至到我们必
死的身体里。（6，9 ～ 10。）这分赐就是膏油的涂
抹，（约壹二 20，27，）而膏油的涂抹就是内住之
灵的运行。那些爱主并保持与主有交通的基督徒，
常常感觉他们里面有东西在运行着。那运行就是膏
油的涂抹，而那膏油的涂抹就是三一神、基督之死、
和基督之复活的分赐。那分赐包括这一切元素：神
性、基督的人性、基督的死、祂死的功效、基督的
复活、和祂复活的大能。
当我们在这分赐之下，我们天然的生命就被杀死，我
们的肉体就被钉十字架。在这分赐、这膏油涂抹、这内
住之灵的运行之下，我们就经历到基督的死。正当我们
要发脾气的时候，我们可能停下自己而去祷告。经过祷
告之后，我们的怒气就过去了。这是因为我们的祷告使
内住之灵的运行发动，而在这运行之内有杀死的能力。

我们应当在我们灵、魂、体里与运行的灵合作，
并接受环境。我们必须乐意，在我们全人的每一部
分里与内住的灵合作，并接受外面的环境。…这杀
死乃是借着内住的灵，以及环境作为杀死的武器而
完成的。…我们必须天天经历主的杀死，就是祂的
治死，然后我们在基督的复活里就天天有得胜和喜
乐。（基督徒的生活，一三一、一九一、一二九至

so that the life of Jesus could be manifested in him.

Christ’s death and its effectiveness, with which the Spirit has been
compounded, become prevailing in the Spirit…. If we enjoy and experience
the Spirit, His death becomes prevailing in us. The death of Christ is in the
Spirit.

The compounded Spirit dwells in our spirit to dispense Christ’s death
and its effectiveness from our spirit to our soul and even to our mortal body
(Rom. 8:6, 9-10). This dispensing is the anointing (1 John 2:20, 27), and the
anointing is the moving of the indwelling Spirit. Those Christians who love
the Lord and maintain fellowship with the Lord, always have the feeling
and sensation that something is moving within them. That moving is the
anointing, and that anointing is the dispensing of the Triune God, of the death
of Christ, and of the resurrection of Christ. That dispensing comprises all
these elements: divinity, Christ’s humanity, Christ’s death, the effectiveness
of His death, Christ’s resurrection, and the power of His resurrection.
It is under this dispensing, this anointing, this moving of the indwelling
Spirit, that we experience the death of Christ. When we are about to lose our
temper, we may stop ourselves and go to pray. After our prayer, our anger is
over. This is because our prayer activates the moving of the indwelling Spirit,
and within this moving there is the killing power.

We should cooperate with the operating Spirit and accept the
environment in our spirit, soul, and body. In every part of our being, we must
be willing to cooperate with the indwelling Spirit and to accept the outward
environment….This killing is carried out by the indwelling Spirit with the
environment as the killing weapon. We need to experience the Lord’s killing,
His putting to death, every day. Then we will daily have the victory and joy
in Christ’s resurrection. (CWWL, 1991-1992, vol. 2, “The Christian Life,” pp.

林后四 10“身体上常带着耶稣的治死，使耶稣的
生命也显明在我们的身体上。”

2 Cor. 4:10 Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus
that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.

16 ～ 17“所以我们不丧胆，反而我们外面的人虽
然在毁坏，我们里面的人却日日在更新。因为
我们这短暂轻微的苦楚，要极尽超越地为我们
成就永远重大的荣耀。”

16-17 Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is
decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. For our
momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more
surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory.

对我们基督徒而言，我们不该有报复和为自己报
仇的想法。…赦免并忘记别人的过错，就是模成基
督的死。

To us Christians there should be no thought of revenge or avenging
ourselves….To forgive and forget others’ mistakes is the conformation to the
death of Christ.

我们里面有这样作的性能；这性能就是复活的大
能。…在一粒小小的种子里面，不仅有生命，也有
复活。这粒种子如果落在土里死了，至终就会从土
底下长出苗来。那是复活的大能。我们都象小小的
种子，我们越被置于死，就越有复活大能的彰显。
这就是为什么我们愿意赦免人，并忘记人的过错。
（基督徒的生活，二○六至二○七页。）

借着受苦，我们就有机会更多得着神。至终，在
经过许多受苦之后，神就更多在我们里面。只要我
们更多得着神，这才是真正重要的事。
在〔保罗〕活着就是基督，而活基督就是显大基
督。（腓一 20 ～ 21 上。）甚至当他在罗马监狱里，
也没有一事叫他羞愧。…甚至当他在监狱里，人在他
身上也看见基督。显出的基督乃是出于基督之杀死的
生命，这就是在基督的钉十字架下生活行动的意思。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 - 第 3 周 晨兴圣言 - 第 11 页

We have the capacity within us to do this, and this capacity is the power of
resurrection….Within a small seed there is not only life but also resurrection.
If that seed falls into the earth and dies, a sprout will eventually rise up from
underneath the earth. That is the power of resurrection. We are like small
seeds. The more we are put into death, the more we have the expression of
the power of resurrection. This is why we like to forgive people and forget
their mistakes. (CWWL, 1991-1992, vol. 2, “The Christian Life,” pp. 492-493)

Today’s Reading

Through our sufferings, we have the opportunity to gain more of God.
Eventually, after passing through many sufferings, we have more of God in us.
As long as we have more of God, this is what really matters.

For [Paul], to live was Christ, and to live Christ was to magnify Christ
(Phil. 1:20-21a). Even when he was in a Roman prison, he did not want to be
put to shame…. Even when he was in prison, people saw Christ in him. The
manifested Christ is the life that comes out of the killing of Christ. This is
what it means to live and walk under the crucifixion of Christ.
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival - Week 3 - Page 11

如果基督徒的生活只是快乐的生活，使徒保罗就
不必吩咐我们要喜乐。（四 4。）当我们在受苦并擦
去眼泪的时候，我们应当喜乐。我们要哭，并不需要
任何鼓励。保罗没有吩咐我们要在主里哭泣，但他的
确吩咐我们要在主里喜乐。我们若不操练我们的灵，
而在杀死的环境中喜乐，我们就不能有任何的喜乐。
神在祂的主宰里，一直把我们摆在十字架的杀死
之下。使徒保罗是在十字架的杀死之下，我们也是
如此。…这是神的神圣安排。（基督徒的生活，二
○八、一九一至一九三页。）
当主所有的儿女都经过更新的过程，成为新耶路
撒冷的时候，他们就会在完全更新的情形里。圣城
叫作新耶路撒冷，因为那里没有神旧造的旧元素。
我们经过患难的时候，在我们里面需要日日不断地
有 更 新， 使 神 能 完 成 祂 的 心 意。（ 日 日 在 更 新，
二六页。）
在与我们日常生活有关的每一种情形中，我们必
须问自己，我们是否凭神圣的生命活着，还是凭我
们天然的生命活着。我们若这样作，往往就会看见，
我们乃是凭我们天然的生命活着，凭我们的己活着。
这时，我们就需要来到十字架。（路九 23。）来到
十字架就是被模成基督的死。…我们乃是蒙神拣选、
呼召、并圣别的人，以实行祂的旨意。实行神的旨
意对我们天然的生命完全是一种受苦。不仅如此，
我们也是蒙拯救、重生、并分别出来的人，我们不
凭天然的生命活着，乃凭神圣的生命活着。…我们
喜欢凭自己作事。不凭我们的生命，却凭另一位的
生命作事，乃是一种受苦。这就是基督徒的生活。
（基督徒的生活，二一六至二一七页。）

If the Christian life were merely a happy life, the apostle Paul would not
have needed to charge us to rejoice (Phil. 4:4). While we are suffering and
wiping away our tears, we should rejoice. In order to weep, we do not need
any kind of encouragement. Paul does not charge us to weep in the Lord, but
he does charge us to rejoice in the Lord. If we do not exercise our spirit to
rejoice in the midst of our killing environment, we cannot have any joy.
God in His sovereignty is putting us all the time under the killing of the
cross. The apostle Paul was under the killing of the cross, and so are we….
This is God’s divine arrangement. (CWWL, 1991-1992, vol. 2, “The Christian
Life,” pp. 493, 481-482)
When all of the Lord’s children pass through the process of renewing to
become the New Jerusalem, they will be in a state of being fully renewed. The
holy city is called the New Jerusalem because it has no old element of God’s
old creation. As we pass through afflictions, there needs to be a continual
renewing taking place in us day by day so that God can accomplish His
heart’s desire. (CWWL, 1989, vol. 2, “Being Renewed Day by Day,” p. 363)
In every situation related to our daily living, we need to ask ourselves
whether we are living by the divine life or by our natural life. If we do this,
quite often we will realize that we are living by our natural life, our self. At
such times we need to go to the cross (Luke 9:23). To go to the cross is to
be conformed to the death of Christ….We are those who have been chosen,
called, and sanctified by God to do His will. Doing the will of God is altogether
a suffering to our natural life. Moreover, we are those who have been saved,
regenerated, and separated to live not by our natural life but by the divine
life….We like to do things by ourselves. To do something not by our life but
by the life of another is a suffering. This is the Christian life. (CWWL, 19911992, vol. 2, “The Christian Life,” p. 500)

壹 按照圣经的神圣启示，有两棵树、两个源 I. According to the divine revelation in the Scriptures, there are
two trees, two sources, two ways, two principles, and two
头、两条路、两个原则、两个终结：
consummations:
一 生命树表征三一神在人与神的关系上，作人的
生命；善恶知识树表征魔鬼撒但，就是那恶者，
在人于神面前堕落的事上，对人乃是死亡—创
二 9，17，诗三六 9 上。

二 生命树是寻求神作生命，以得着供应与享受之
人的源头；善恶知识树是跟随撒但作毒物，以
至于死，并永远沉沦之人的源头—约一 4，十五
1，八 44。

【周二】
三 第一条路是生命的路，就是狭路，给人寻求神，
得着神，并在神永远的生命里享受神作供应；
第二条路是死亡并善恶的路，就是阔路，让人
跟随撒但，作他的儿女—太七 13 ～ 14，徒九 2，
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 4 周纲要 - 第 1 页

A. The tree of life signifies the Triune God as life to man in man’s
relationship with Him; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
signifies Satan, the devil, the evil one, as death to man in man’s fall
before God—Gen. 2:9, 17; Psa. 36:9a.
B. The tree of life is the source of men who seek God as life for their
supply and enjoyment; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is
the source of men who follow Satan as their poison unto death and
eternal perdition—John 1:4; 15:1; 8:44.

§Day 2

C. The first way is the way of life, the constricted way, for men to seek
God, to gain God, and to enjoy God in His eternal life as the supply; the
second way is the way of death and of good and evil, the broad way,
for men to follow Satan to be his children—Matt. 7:13-14; Acts 9:2; 1

四 第一个原则是生命的原则—倚靠神的原则；第
二个原则是死亡并善恶的原则—向神独立的原
则—创四 3 ～ 4，耶十七 5 ～ 8，约十五 5。
五 两个终结乃是两棵树、两个源头、两条路、和
两个原则的最终结果：
1 神生命之路的终结乃是生命水的城，也就是新耶路
撒冷—启二一 2，9 ～ 11，二二 1 ～ 2。
2 死亡并善恶之路的终结乃是火湖—十九 20，二十
10，14 ～ 15。

【周三】

John 3:10a.

D. The first principle is the principle of life—the principle of dependence
on God; the second principle is the principle of death and of good and
evil—the principle of independence from God—Gen. 4:3-4; Jer. 17:58; John 15:5.
E. The two consummations are the final outcome of the two trees, the
two sources, the two ways, and the two principles:

1. The consummation of God’s way of life is a city of water of life, the New
Jerusalem—Rev. 21:2, 9-11; 22:1-2.

2. The consummation of the way of death and of good and evil is a lake of
fire—19:20; 20:10, 14-15.

A. The logic of Job and his friends was according to the line of the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil; they were devoid of the divine
revelation and of the experience of the divine life—Job 2:11—32:1.

B. Job, like his friends, was halted in the knowledge of right and wrong,
not knowing God’s economy—4:7-8:
1. Neither Job nor his friends were in the line of the tree of life as God
ordained man to be—Gen. 2:9.

2. Their concept concerning man’s relationship with God was built on good
and evil, right and wrong, absolutely according to the principle of the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil and absolutely according to the human,
ethical concept of fallen man—Job 8:1-20.

A. The tree of life signifies the Triune God in Christ to dispense Himself
into His chosen people as life in the form of food—Gen. 2:9.
B. The tree of life is the center of the universe:

1. According to the purpose of God, the earth is the center of the universe, the
garden of Eden is the center of the earth, and the tree of life is the center of
the garden of Eden; hence, the universe is centered on the tree of life.
2. Nothing is more central and crucial to both God and man than the tree of
life—3:22; Rev. 22:14.

C. The New Testament reveals that Christ is the fulfillment of the figure
of the tree of life—John 1:4; 15:5.

肆 创世记二章九节的两棵树—生命树与善恶 IV. The two trees in Genesis 2:9—the tree of life and the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil—represent two principles of living:

围里的东西—十五 28，弗三 16 ～ 21。
三 基督徒不是讲是非的原则，善恶的原则，乃是
讲生命—约壹五 11 ～ 13，20：
1 当我们接受主耶稣，得着新的生命之后，我们多了
一个生活的原则—生命的原则；我们如果不知道，
就会把生命的原则摆在一边，而跟从是非的原则。
2 在我们实际的生活上，我们也许不是在生命树的线

A. The two trees show that a Christian can live according to two different
principles—the principle of right and wrong or the principle of life—1
Cor. 8:1.
B. Job and his friends pursued something in the realm of ethics, but
we, the believers in Christ, should pursue something in the realm of
God—15:28; Eph. 3:16-21.

C. Being a Christian is not a matter of the principle of right and wrong, the
principle of good and evil, but is a matter of life—1 John 5:11-13, 20:

1. When we received the Lord Jesus and gained a new life, we obtained
another principle of living—the principle of life; if we do not know this
principle, we will set the principle of life aside and follow the principle of
right and wrong.

2. In our practical living we may not be in the line of the tree of life but in
the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil—Prov. 16:25; 21:2.

3. In our daily living we should not be in the realm of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil but in the realm of the life-giving Spirit—1
Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2.

4. In order to live according to the principle of the tree of life, we need to
follow the inner sense of life—v. 6; Eph. 4:18-19; Isa. 40:31:
a. The sense of life on the negative side is the feeling of death—Rom. 8:6a.

b. The sense of life on the positive side is the feeling of life and peace, with a

5. When we live according to the principle of the tree of life, we will care not for
good and evil but for life, and we will discern matters not according to right
and wrong but according to life and death—Gen. 2:9, 16-17; 2 Cor. 11:3.

A. We are a miniature garden of Eden because the triangular situation
involving God, man, and Satan is now within us—Gen. 1:27-29; 2:9,
16-17:
1. Before man fell, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of
life were outside of man—vv. 9, 16-17.

2. Through the fall the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is in us, and
through regeneration the tree of life is now in us.
3. Our spirit is mingled with the Triune God, and our body, which has
become the flesh, is mixed with the sinful element of Satan (1 Cor. 6:17;
Rom. 5:12; 6:6, 12); this makes the Christian a miniature garden of Eden.

B. As those who were represented by Adam in Genesis 2, we have the
tree of life in our spirit and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
in our flesh—v. 9; Rev. 2:7b; 22:14:

1. Whenever we contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, we
become dead; whenever we contact the tree of life, we gain life—Rom.
8:5-6, 10.

2. If we stand on the side of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and
contact Satan, we will live out the life of Satan, the devil, and the result

who dwells in our spirit and stay one with Him—v. 6b; 1 Cor. 6:17.

and strength; our thirst is quenched, and our hunger is satisfied—Rom.
8:5, 6b; John 4:14; 7:37-38; Matt. 5:6.

3. When we set our mind on the spirit, our mind is full of life and peace—
Rom. 8:6b:

a. We have peace because there is no discord between our outward behavior
and our inner being—v. 6b; Isa. 9:6-7; 26:3.
b. When we speak with our mind set on the spirit, life is embodied in our
words because we are one spirit with the Lord—Prov. 18:21; John 6:63;
Eph. 4:29.

创二 9“耶和华神使各样的树从地里长出来，可
以悦人的眼目，也好作食物；园子当中有生命
树，还有善恶知识树。”

Gen. 2:9 And out of the ground Jehovah God caused to grow every tree that
is pleasant to the sight and good for food, as well as the tree of life in the
middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

17“只是善恶知识树上的果子，你不可吃，因为
你吃的日子必定死。”

17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat;
for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.

在创世记二章有两棵树—生命树和善恶知识树。
但到了启示录二十一至二十二章，我们只看见一棵
树—生命树—在一座圣城里。在这城的中心有神和
羔羊的宝座，（二二 1，）指明神的行政。…从神和
羔羊的宝座，就是从这一位神，流出一道河，在河
两岸长着生命树。（2 上。）按原则说，若是生命树
结束于水城，善恶知识树就必是结束于火湖。启示
录二十二章里一切邪恶的东西，都联于火湖。因此，
两个结局乃是水城和火湖。在这两个源头和两个结
局之间，有两条线，成为两条路。每一个源头带进
一条线，这条线成为一条路，终结于一个结局。（约
伯记生命读经，二三二至二三三页。）

In Genesis 2 there are two trees—the tree of life and the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil. However, in Revelation 21 and 22 we see only
one tree—the tree of life—in a holy city. In the center of this city is the throne
of God and of the Lamb (22:1), indicating God’s administration….Out of the
throne of God and of the Lamb, that is, out of the one God, flows a river, and
on the two sides of this river grows the tree of life (22:2a). According to the
principle, if the tree of life ends in the city of water, the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil must end in the lake of fire. All the evil things in Revelation
22 are involved with the lake of fire. Thus, the two ends are the city of water
and the lake of fire. Between the two sources and the two ends are two lines,
which become two ways. Each source issues in a line that becomes a way
consummating in an end. (Life-study of Job, pp. 197-198)

The Bible, as a full record of the divine revelation, is a book of signs (Rev.
1:1b)….The tree of life, as the highest sign, signifies God, even the Triune
God, as life to man in man’s relationship with Him (Psa. 36:9a)….The tree of
the knowledge of good and evil, as the highest negative sign, signifies Satan
the devil, even the evil one, as death to man in man’s fall before God (Gen.

elements….The second tree signifies Satan as death, with the implications of

恶。神是简单的，撒但却很复杂。
照着神圣的启示，知识是撒但，善是撒但，恶也
是撒但。今天的世界是个崇拜知识的世代。亚当和
夏娃在吃善恶知识树以前是无知的，不知罪，所以
没有罪。他们吃了知识树以后，眼睛明亮了，他们
就有了知识，那就是罪。我们都认为犯罪是罪，却
不认为知道罪也是罪。
真正的善乃是神自己；（太十九 17 中；）因此，
得着神就等于得着真正的善。当那富有的青年官来
到主耶稣那里，称祂为“良善的夫子”，主耶稣说，
“你为什么称我是良善的？除了神一位以外，再没
有良善的。”（可十 17 ～ 18。）我们若在神以外得
着任何别的善，那是可怕的。我们若摸着神以外的
善事，这就是说我们摸着撒但。
这两棵树不是为着产生材料，乃是为给人吃其上
的果子。（创三 3，6 下。）生命树的果子成为滋养
人的食物，为着分赐生命；善恶知识树的果子成为
杀死人的毒物。吃就是把外面的东西接受进来，消
化并吸收。我们必须谨慎我们吃的是什么。今天的
电视和许多种的报纸和杂志，无疑是善恶知识树的
枝子。

knowledge, good, and evil.

Whereas God is simple, Satan is very complicated. According to the divine
revelation, knowledge is Satan, good is Satan, and evil is Satan. Today the
world is in an age that worships knowledge. Before eating of the fruit of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve were ignorant, not
knowing, so they had no sin. After they ate of the tree of knowledge, their eyes
were opened, and they became knowledgeable. That was sin. We all consider
that to commit sin is sin, but we may not consider that knowing sin is sin.

The genuine good is God Himself (Matt. 19:17a); hence, gaining God
equals gaining the genuine good. When the rich young ruler came to the Lord
Jesus and called Him, “Good Teacher,” the Lord Jesus said, “Why do you call
Me good? No one is good except One—God” (Mark 10:17-18). If besides God
we gain any other good, that is terrible. If we touch the good things outside
of God, this means that we touch Satan.

The two trees are not for producing materials but for man to eat their
fruit (Gen. 3:3, 6b), the fruit of the tree of life becoming food to man
for nourishing, for the dispensing of life, and the fruit of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil becoming poison to man for killing. To eat means
to take in something that is outside of us and then digest and assimilate it.
We must be careful concerning what we eat. Surely, today’s television and so
many different kinds of newspapers and magazines are branches of the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil.
The two trees, as signs of God and Satan, are the two sources of two
categories of men. The first tree is the source of men who seek God as life for
their supply and enjoyment, of whom Abel is the leading one (Gen. 4:4). The
second tree is the source of men who follow Satan as their poison unto death
and eternal perdition. (Life-study of Job, pp. 198-200)

善恶的路上转到这条生命的路上，使他能得着神到最完

Two lines, as the two ways, originate from the two sources. The first
way is the way of life, the constricted way (Matt. 7:14), the Way (Acts
9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:22), the straight way (2 Pet. 2:15), the way of
righteousness (2 Pet. 2:21), the way of salvation (Acts 16:17), the way
of God (Matt. 22:16; Acts 18:26), and the way of the Lord (Acts 18:25),
for men to seek God, to gain God, and to enjoy God in His eternal life as
the supply and unto His eternal life as the goal, that they may be born of
God in His life and nature (John 1:12-13), transformed and conformed
into His glorious image (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29), and glorified in Him as
glory (Rom. 8:30; 1 Pet. 5:10a; Heb. 2:10a) to gain Him and participate in
Him to the fullest extent. In this way of life are Abel, Seth, Enosh, Enoch,
Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Samuel, all the Old Testament
prophets, and all the New Testament believers (Heb. 11:39-40). God’s
purpose in dealing with Job was to turn him from the way of good and evil
to this way of life that he might gain God to the fullest extent. (Life-study

引到神命定的两个结局—新耶路撒冷和火湖。
两 条 路， 就 是 生 命 的 路， 和 死 亡 并 善 恶 的 路，
构成支配、管治、并规律人与神建立关系的两个原
则。…第一个原则是生命的原则，按照这原则，所有
在生命路上的人保持与神的接触，并且借着这原则一
步一步地寻求神、得着神、拥有神并享受神，直至达
到最完满的地步。…第二个原则是死亡并善恶的原
则，在这原则里，所有在死亡路上的人都有意识或无
意识地跟随撒但，并且借此弃绝神和祂生命的路，而
成为撒但的同伴，以至于死和永远的沉沦。

(2 Pet. 2:15; Jude 11b), Saul, Absalom, Antichrist and his followers (Rev.
19:19-21), and all unbelievers (Rev. 20:15).
These two ways, the way of life and the way of death, lead men to the two
God-ordained ends—the New Jerusalem and the lake of fire—respectively.

The two ways, the way of life and the way of death and of good and evil,
constitute the two controlling, ruling, and regulating principles by which men
have their relationship with God. The first principle is the principle of life,
according to which all men in the way of life keep their contact with God, and
by which they seek God, gain God, possess God, and enjoy God, step by step,
until they reach the fullest extent. The second principle is the principle of
death and of good and evil, in which all men in the way of death follow Satan
either consciously or unconsciously, and through which they reject God and
His way of life to be Satan’s companions unto death and eternal perdition.

The two ends are the two destinations of the two ways men take in their
relationship with God. The New Jerusalem, as the best and most glorious
end of God’s way of life, is a dynamic incentive for us to seek God until we
gain Him to the fullest extent according to His love and grace; and the lake
of fire, as the worst and most miserable end of Satan’s way of death and of
good and evil, should be a solemn warning to the men who follow Satan in
his way against God’s economy, to turn from his way of death to God’s way
of life that they may escape Satan’s eternal judgment and eternal perdition,
according to God’s righteousness and justice. (Life-study of Job, pp. 201203)

After God created Adam, He placed him in front of two trees—the tree of life
and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil….God wanted Adam to eat of the
tree of life. If Adam had eaten of the tree of life, this tree would have entered
into him and then would have grown within him. However, Adam ate instead of
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This tree was thus sown into Adam
and grew within him, and it has been growing in all of Adam’s descendants. At
Job’s time the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was only two thousand
years old, but now it is six thousand years old. Today the entire human race
is a race constituted according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
In every human society, regardless of the kind of ethics it has, the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil is growing. As long as this tree is growing among
the human race, there will be no peace. (Life-study of Job, pp. 29-30)

spouse we may not only grow this tree but also water it and fertilize it. What,
then, should we do? We need to remember Paul’s word in Galatians 2:20—”It
is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me”—and turn from the
tree of knowledge to the tree of life. If we do this, we will live Christ and grow
Christ as the tree of life.

Job, like his friends, was halted in the knowledge of right and wrong, not
knowing God’s economy, not realizing in an adequate way the purpose of
God’s creating of man. He and his friends were devoid of the divine revelation
and of the experience of the divine life. He had no idea that God had no
intention to increase his perfection, uprightness, righteousness, and integrity.
Rather, God’s intention was to strip all these human virtues which he had as
his contentment, that he could seek and gain only God Himself. Neither his
friends nor he were in the line of the tree of life as God ordained man to be.

In our daily living we should not be in the realm of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil but should be in the realm of the life-giving Spirit. We should
not do anything according to good and evil. Instead, we should do everything
according to the Spirit by being one spirit with the Lord. For instance, we need
to be one spirit with the Lord in our speaking. Before I speak for the Lord, I
pray one simple prayer: “Lord, be one spirit with me that I may be one spirit
with You. Lord, speak in my speaking and make my speaking Your speaking.”
This is to live in the dispensing of the eternal economy of God. When we live
and speak in this way, we enjoy the divine dispensing, and Christ increases
within us. Christ grows in us and we grow in Christ.

Suppose there is a problem between you and your spouse. You should
not do anything, for whatever you do will be in the realm of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil. You should simply pray-read Galatians 2:20….
Do not care for the problem or your anger—just care for Christ living in you.
This should be our way in everything. (Life-study of Job, pp. 30, 40, 72)

The New Testament reveals Christ as the fulfillment of the figure of the
tree of life. Speaking of Christ, John 1:4 says, “In Him was life.” Since John
1:3 refers to the creation in Genesis 1, the mention of life in verse 4 should
refer to the life indicated by the tree of life in Genesis 2. This is confirmed by
John’s mention of the tree of life in Revelation 22. The life displayed by the
tree of life in Genesis 2 was the life incarnated in Christ. The Lord told us that
He Himself is life (John 14:6). Furthermore, John 15 reveals that Christ is a
tree, the vine tree. On the one hand, He is a tree; on the other hand, He is life.
If we put together John 1:4 and 15:5, we shall realize that Christ is the tree of
life. The fact that He said in John 6 that He is the bread of life indicates that
He has come to us as the tree of life in the form of food. Therefore, Christ, the
embodiment of God, is the tree of life.
Concerning Christ as the fulfillment of the figure of the tree of life in
Genesis 2:9, Revelation 2:7 says, “To him who overcomes, to him I will

original intention that man should eat of the tree of life. Due to the fall, the
tree of life was closed to man (Gen. 3:22-24). Through the redemption of
Christ, the way to touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life
to man, has been opened again (Heb. 10:19-20). However, in the church’s
degradation religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in
Christ from eating Him as the tree of life. Hence, in Revelation 2:7 the Lord
promises to grant the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life. The
word for tree in Revelation 2:7, as in 1 Peter 2:24, is wood in Greek, not the
usual word used for tree. We have seen that the tree of life refers to Christ as
the embodiment of the Triune God to be our life in the form of food. Here in
Revelation 2:7 this expression refers to the crucified (implied in the tree as a
piece of wood—1 Peter 2:24) and resurrected (implied in the zoe life—John
11:25) Christ who is in the church today, the consummation of which will be
the New Jerusalem, in which the crucified and resurrected Christ will be the
tree of life for the enjoyment of all God’s redeemed people for eternity (Rev.
22:2, 14). The eating of the tree of life not only was God’s original intention
concerning man; it will also be the eternal issue of Christ’s redemption. For
eternity God’s redeemed people will enjoy the tree of life as their portion.
The tree of life growing on the two sides of the river [Rev. 22:2] indicates
that the tree of life is a vine, spreading and proceeding along the flow of
the water of life for God’s people to receive and enjoy. It fulfills, for eternity,
what God intended from the beginning. In eternity God’s redeemed people
will enjoy the tree of life; that is, they will enjoy Christ, the Son of God, the
redeeming Lamb, as their eternal life supply.
Through Christ’s redemption, which has fulfilled the requirements of
God’s glory, holiness, and righteousness, the way to the tree of life has been
opened again to the believers. Hence, the believers who wash their robes in
the redeeming blood of Christ have the right to enjoy the tree of life as their
eternal portion. (The Conclusion of the New Testament, pp. 429-430)

Christianity is not a matter of asking whether something is right or
wrong. Christianity is a matter of checking with the life inside us whenever
we do something. What does the new life which God has given us tell
us inwardly about this matter?…Christianity does not require that we
ask whether something is right or wrong, good or evil. On the contrary,
whenever we do anything, there is a life within us which rises up to speak
with us. When we feel right inwardly, when we feel the life inside of us
moving, when we are strong within and sense the anointing, we know that
we have life. Many times something is right and good in the eyes of man,
but strangely the inner life has no response and grows cold and retreats.
God’s Word tells us that our Christian living is based on an inner life, not
an outward standard of right and wrong. Many worldly people, who are
not saved, live according to the best standard of living they can attain: the
principle of right and wrong. If you or I also live by the principle of right

non-Christians because we do not live by an outward standard or law. Our
subject is not human morality or concepts. We do not determine whether
something is right or wrong by subjecting it to human criticism or opinion.
Today we have only one question: What does our inner life say? If the life is
strong and active within us, we can do this; if the life is cold and retreating
within us, we should not.

Sometimes we come across a brother who has acted very foolishly.
According to what is proper, we should strongly exhort or rebuke him….We
prepare ourselves to face the situation…. He acted foolishly, so what can we
do but exhort him? We have gone to his door and raised our hand to knock,
but inwardly there is a problem. Our raised hand drops to our side. Even
though we have convinced ourselves that we are right, this is not a matter of
right or wrong. This is a matter of whether or not the life of God allows us.
Many times when we go to exhort a brother, he will receive our exhortation
with courtesy and promise to do what God says. Yet the more we preach to
him, the more our inward being wilts. When we return home, we have to
admit that we have been wrong in exhorting the brother! Therefore, it is not
a matter of good or bad but a matter of being full of life inwardly.
I met a needy brother a few days ago…. I thought that I certainly should
do something for him because there was no prospect of help coming to
him from any direction. Just at that point I had no surplus, so it was a
great sacrifice to come to his aid. I seemed to be exceeding the limits of my
strength to help him…. I should have been happy as I gave him some money.
Yet for some unknown reason, I wilted inwardly as I gave him the money
which I had promised to give him. A voice within said, “You are just acting on
charity. That was not an act of life; it was merely human chivalry and natural
kindness. It was not done in life but in yourself.” God did not want me to do
this…. Even though I had given the brother money, I had to bow before God,
confess my sin, and ask His forgiveness when I reached home. (CWWN, vol.
56, pp. 421-422, 429-430)

你自己，你肉体中的罪代表撒但，而你灵中的那灵代表
神。就象在伊甸园里，这三方在我们里面形成了三角的
局面。（创世记生命读经，二一七至二一八页。）

信息选读
这三角局面的种子撒在创世记二章，它的生长是
在罗马八章，在那里我们看到那两棵树的出现。六
节说，“心思置于肉体，就是死；心思置于灵，乃
是生命平安。”创世记二章的两棵树是客观的，罗
马八章的两棵树是主观的。我们绝不能说，这两棵
树不再同我们在一起了。甚至在你读这篇信息时，
它们就在你里面。…因此在八章我们看到一个今日
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 - 第 4 周 晨兴圣言 - 第 11 页

Man is tripartite: he has a spirit, soul, and body. The spirit is our
innermost part, the body is our outermost part, and the soul, the main part
of our being, stands between them. As a result of the fall, Satan as the tree of
knowledge came into man’s flesh. As a result of our believing in Christ, God
as the tree of life came into our spirit. Therefore, the two trees that were
once in the garden outside of man are now within us, one in our flesh and
the other in our spirit. If we read Romans 7 carefully, we will see that Paul
said in his flesh nothing good dwells, only sin. Sin is actually the evil nature
of Satan. To say that sin dwells in our flesh means that Satan, the evil one, is
in our flesh. Romans 8:16, a verse which proves that God is in us, says that
the Spirit of God witnesses with our spirit. Thus, every genuine Christian is a
miniature garden of Eden. The mind of your soul represents your self, sin in
your flesh represents Satan, and the Spirit in your spirit represents God. As
in the garden of Eden, the three parties form a triangular situation within us.
(Life-study of Genesis, p. 177)

Today’s Reading

The seed of this triangular situation was sown in Genesis 2, and the
growth of the seed is found in Romans 8, where we see the outcrop of the
two trees. Romans 8:6 says that the mind set on the flesh is death and
that the mind set on the spirit is life and peace. In Genesis 2 the two trees
were objective; in Romans 8 they are subjective. We should never say that
these two trees are no longer with us. Even as you read this message, they
are within you….Thus, in Romans 8 we find a present-day garden of Eden.

的伊甸园。二节说到生命之灵的律，释放我们脱离
了罪与死的律。所以，在八章有两个律—生命的律
和死的律。这两个律是在我们主观经历中两棵树的
两个原则。（创世记生命读经，二一八页。）
在园子里，人一面是面对生命树，另一面是面对
知识树。现今，我们这些由创世记二章的亚当所代
表的人，在我们的灵里有生命树，在我们的肉体里
有知识树。我们需要决定，我们要将心思置于肉体，
受死的苦，还是将心思置于灵，享受生命平安。借
着将心思置于灵，我们就住在基督里；祂是那住在
我们灵里赐生命的灵。
我们已从罗马八章知道，我们所需要作的一切，
就是将我们这人转向那住在我们灵里活的一位，并与
祂是一。我们转向祂，并将我们的心思置于祂，就有
生命、平安、亮光、安慰、力量、和我们所需要的一
切。我们的干渴就得解除，我们的饥饿也得饱足。
要将我们这人置于调和的灵，我们就需要祷告。
我们何等容易受打岔，离开我们灵里神圣的灵！我
们的心思很快就受其他事物的吸引。所以，我们需
要祷告，主要地不是求主为我们作事，乃是使我们
的心思置于灵。要确信，主会顾到你，并为你作每
件事。因此，你在祷告中不需要被你的需要〔就如
爱或忍耐〕占有；乃要祷告，与你灵里这活的一位
保持接触。你越与祂保持接触，就越享受祂。…我
们只该赞美主，祂是我们的爱、我们的忍耐、和我
们的一切。我们若这样赞美祂，宣告主是何等美善，
自然而然爱和忍耐会从我们身上流出。…我们越将
心思置于我们灵里这活的一位，祂就越从我们活出
祂自己。（罗马书生命读经，五三一至五三四页。）

Romans 8:2 mentions the law of the Spirit of life, which sets us free from the
law of sin and death. Therefore, in Romans 8 we have two laws—the law of
life and the law of death. These two laws are the two principles of the two
trees in our subjective experience. (Life-study of Genesis, pp. 177-178)

In the garden man faced the tree of life on the one hand and the tree of
knowledge on the other. Now, as those who were represented by Adam in
Genesis 2, we have the tree of life in our spirit and the tree of knowledge in
our flesh. We need to decide whether we shall set our mind on the flesh and
suffer death or whether we shall set our mind on the spirit and enjoy life and
peace. By setting our mind on the spirit we abide in Christ who as the lifegiving Spirit dwells in our spirit.
We have learned from Romans 8 that all we need to do is turn our being to
the living One who indwells our spirit and stay one with Him. When we turn
to Him and set our mind on Him, we have life, peace, light, comfort, strength,
and all we need. Our thirst is quenched and our hunger is satisfied.

In order to set our being on the mingled spirit, we need to pray. How
easily we are distracted from the divine Spirit in our spirit! Our mind is so
quickly drawn to other things. Therefore, we need to pray, not mainly to
ask the Lord to do things for us, but to keep our mind set on the spirit. Be
assured, the Lord will take care of you and do everything for you. Hence, in
prayer you need not be occupied with your needs [such as love or patience].
Instead, pray to keep in touch with the living One in your spirit. The more
you keep in contact with Him, the more you will enjoy Him….We should
simply praise the Lord that He is our love, our patience, and our everything.
If we praise Him in this way, declaring how good the Lord is, spontaneously
love and patience will flow out of us….The more we set our mind on the
living One in our spirit, the more He lives Himself out of us. (Life-study of
Romans, pp. 452-454)

神在约伯身上的目的—
好人成为神人

God’s Intention with Job—
a Good Man Becoming a God-man
Hymns: 538

诗歌：诗 399
读经：伯一 1，8，二 3，9，二七 5，三一 6，四二 5 ～ 6，
约一 14，罗一 3 ～ 4，八 29

纲要
【周一、周二】

Scripture Reading: Job 1:1, 8; 2:3, 9; 27:5; 31:6; 42:5-6; John 1:14; Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29

Outline

§Day 1 & Day 2

壹 约伯是一个好人，彰显自己的完全、正直 I. Job was a good man, expressing himself in his perfection,
uprightness, and integrity—Job 27:5; 31:6; 32:1:
和纯全—伯二七 5，三一 6，三二 1：
一 完全，与里面的人有关；正直，与外面的人有
关—一 1。

二 约伯是一个纯全的人；纯全是完全和正直的总
和—二 3，9，二七 5，三一 6：
1 就约伯而言，纯全是他这人的总体表现。
2 在性格上，约伯是完全、正直的；在道德上，他有
高标准的纯全。

三 约伯在积极一面敬畏神，在消极一面远离恶事—一 1：
1 神造人不仅是要人敬畏祂、不犯错；神乃是按着自
己的形像，照着自己的样式造人，为叫人彰显祂—
创一 26。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 5 周纲要 - 第 1 页

A. Being perfect is related to the inner man, and being upright is related
to the outer man—1:1.

B. Job was a man of integrity; integrity is the totality of being perfect and
upright—2:3, 9; 27:5; 31:6:
1. With respect to Job, integrity is the total expression of what he was.

2. In character Job was perfect and upright, and in his ethics he had a high
standard of integrity.

C. Job feared God positively and turned away from evil negatively—1:1:

1. God did not create man merely to fear Him and not do anything wrong;
rather, God created man in His own image and according to His likeness
that man may express God—Gen. 1:26.
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 5 - Page 1

2 彰显神比敬畏神和远离恶事更高。
3 约伯在他的完全、正直和纯全上所达到的，全是虚
空，并没有完成神的定旨，也没有满足神的愿望；
因此，神对约伯有爱的关切—伯一 6 ～ 8，二 1 ～ 3。

四 唯有神知道约伯有一个需要—他里面没有神；
因此，神要约伯得着祂好彰显祂，以完成祂的
定旨—四二 5 ～ 6。

2. To express God is higher than fearing God and turning away from evil.

3. What Job had attained in his perfection, uprightness, and integrity was
altogether vanity; it neither fulfilled God’s purpose nor satisfied His
desire, and thus, He was lovingly concerned for Job—Job 1:6-8; 2:1-3.

D. Only God knew that Job had a need—he did not have God within him;
therefore, God wanted Job to gain Him in order to express Him for the
fulfillment of His purpose—42:5-6.

贰 神的目的是使约伯成为神人，在神的属性 II. God’s intention was that Job would become a God-man,
expressing God in His attributes—22:24-25; 38:1-3:
上彰显祂—二二 24 ～ 25，三八 1 ～ 3：
一 神把约伯引进另一个范围，神的范围里，使他
能得着神，而不是得着他在自己的完全、公义
和纯全上的成就—四二 5 ～ 6。

二 神的目的是要使约伯成为属神的人，充满了作
神具体化身的基督，成为神的丰满，好在基督
里彰显神—提前六 11，提后三 17。
三 神在约伯身上施行剥夺和销毁，好将他拆毁，
使神能有一个根据和一条路，用神自己重建约
伯，使他成为神人，在生命和性情上与神一
样（但无分于祂的神格），好彰显神—弗三
16 ～ 21。
四 神不要我们在基督里的信徒作好人；祂要我们
作神人—约一 12 ～ 13，罗八 16：
1 神按祂自己的形像造了我们，目的是要我们彰显
祂，并有祂的管治权以代表祂—创一 26 ～ 28。
2 我们若只是好人，就无法彰显神或代表神。
3 彰显神并代表神的，不是好人，乃是神人—林后
三 18。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 5 周纲要 - 第 2 页

A. God ushered Job into another realm, the realm of God, so that
Job might gain God instead of his attainments in his perfection,
righteousness, and integrity—42:5-6.

B. God’s intention was to make Job a man of God, filled with Christ, the
embodiment of God, to be the fullness of God for the expression of
God in Christ—1 Tim. 6:11; 2 Tim. 3:17.
C. God’s stripping and consuming were exercised over Job to tear him
down that God might have a base and a way to rebuild him with God
Himself so that he might become a God-man, the same as God in His
life and nature but not in His Godhead, in order to express God—Eph.
3:16-21.
D. God does not want us, the believers in Christ, to be a good man; He
wants us to be a God-man—John 1:12-13; Rom. 8:16:

1. God created us in His own image for the purpose of expressing God and
with His dominion to represent Him—Gen. 1:26-28.

2. If we are merely a good man, we cannot express God or represent Him.

3. It is not a good man but a God-man who expresses God and represents
God—2 Cor. 3:18.
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 5 - Page 2

4 彰显神的神人乃是神的代表，有神的权柄管理万
有—创一 27 ～ 28。

【周三】

4. God-men who express God are God’s representative and have God’s
authority over all things—Gen. 1:27-28.

§Day 3

叁 基督（三一神的具体化身和彰显）的成为 III. The incarnation of Christ, the embodiment and expression of
the Triune God, produced a God-man—Luke 1:31-32a; John
肉体，产生了一位神人—路一 31 ～ 32 上，
1:1, 14, 18, 51:
约一 1，14，18，51：
一 路加福音启示这位神人，祂过属人的生活，满
有神圣的生命为其内容—一 35，二 7 ～ 16，
34 ～ 35，40，49，52。
二 在基督里，神与人成为一个实体，就是神人—
一 35，约一 14，太一 18，20 ～ 23：
1 因着主耶稣是由神圣的素质成孕，且从属人的素质
所生，所以祂生为一个神人；因此，祂这位神人兼
有两种素质—神圣的素质和属人的素质—18 节。
2 圣灵在童女里面的成孕，构成了神性与人性的调
和，产生出一位神人，这一位既是完整的神，又是
完全的人—路一 35。
3 这位神人既是完全的人，又是完整的神，有人性连
同人性的美德，以盛装神并彰显神连同神圣的属性。

【周四】
三 主耶稣这位神人在地上生活，不是凭祂属人的
生命，乃是凭神圣的生命—约五 18 ～ 19，30，
六 57 上：
1 当主耶稣在地上时，虽然祂是人，但祂凭神活着—
57 节上，五 19，30，六 38，八 28，七 16 ～ 18：
a 主耶稣在一切事上活神并彰显神；祂无论作什么，
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 5 周纲要 - 第 3 页

A. The Gospel of Luke is a revelation of the God-man who lived a human
life filled with the divine life as the content—1:35; 2:7-16, 34-35, 40,
49, 52.

B. In Christ, God and man have become one entity, the God-man—1:35;
John 1:14; Matt. 1:18, 20-23:

1. Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the divine essence and born of the
human essence, He was born a God-man; hence, for His being as the God-man,
He had two essences—the divine essence and the human essence—v. 18.
2. The conception of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin constituted a mingling
of the divine nature with the human nature, producing the God-man, the
One who is both the complete God and the perfect man—Luke 1:35.
3. As a perfect man and the complete God, the God-man has the human nature
with its virtues to contain God and express Him with the divine attributes.

§Day 4

C. As the God-man, the Lord Jesus lived on earth not by His human life
but by the divine life—John 5:18-19, 30; 6:57a:
1. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, although He was a man, He lived by
God—v. 57a; 5:19, 30; 6:38; 8:28; 7:16-18:

a. The Lord Jesus lived God and expressed God in everything; whatever He did
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 5 - Page 3

都是神从祂里面并借着祂作出来—十四 10。
b 主耶稣凭神的生命，不凭人的生命，过神人的生
活—六 57 上。
c 祂的为人生活不是凭属人的生命，乃是凭神圣的生
命活出来的—一 4，十一 15，十四 6。
2 因着主耶稣是一直拒绝祂属人的生命，把祂自己一
直摆在十字架底下而活着，祂的为人生活不是彰显
人性，乃是有神圣的属性成为人性的美德而彰显神
性—太十六 21，24。
3 祂在地上的日子，一直否认己，背起十字架，使祂能
活神，有神圣的属性成为人性的美德而彰显神；这
是第一个神人作为原型的生活—路一 31 ～ 32 上，七
11 ～ 16，十 25 ～ 37，十三 10 ～ 16，罗八 3，29。

【周五】

was God’s doing from within Him and through Him—14:10.

b. The Lord Jesus lived as a God-man by the life of God, not by the life of man—
6:57a.

c. His human living was not lived out by the human life but by the divine life—
1:4; 11:25; 14:6.
2. Because the Lord Jesus always lived by rejecting His human life—
by always putting Himself under the cross—His human living did not
express humanity but divinity in the divine attributes becoming human
virtues—Matt. 16:21, 24.

3. All His days on the earth, He denied Himself and took up the cross so
that He might live God to express God in His divine attributes becoming
human virtues; this was the life of the first God-man as a prototype—
Luke 1:31-32a; 7:11-16; 10:25-37; 13:10-16; Rom. 8:3, 29.

§Day 5

肆 起初圣经说到这位神人；这位神人借着祂 IV. Initially, the Bible speaks of the God-man; through His
resurrection this God-man was reproduced as the many God的复活被复制为许多神人—罗一 3 ～ 4，八
men—Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29; Heb. 2:10:
29，来二 10：
一 第一个神人主耶稣乃是原型，为着产生许多神
人，祂的复制—彼前二 21。
二 神成为人，为要得着祂自己的大量复制，因而
产生新的一类；这新的一类乃是神人类—罗八
3，29，来二 10。
三 这位神人主耶稣，乃是一粒麦子落在地里，为
要产生许多子粒作祂的复制—约十二 24：
1 头一个子粒—第一个神人—是原型，由这一子粒借
着死与复活所产生的许多子粒—许多神人—乃是这
第一个神人的复制。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 5 周纲要 - 第 4 页

A. The Lord Jesus, the first God-man, is the prototype for the producing
of the many God-men, His reproduction—1 Pet. 2:21.

B. God became man to have a mass reproduction of Himself and thereby
to produce a new kind; this new kind is God-man kind—Rom. 8:3, 29;
Heb. 2:10.
C. The Lord Jesus, the God-man, was a grain of wheat falling into the ground
in order to produce many grains as His reproduction—John 12:24:

1. The first grain—the first God-man—was the prototype, and the many
grains—the many God-men—produced by this one grain through death
and resurrection are the reproduction of the first God-man.
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 5 - Page 4

2 许多子粒—许多神人—乃是神的复制；这样的复制
使神喜乐，因为祂的复制看起来象祂，说话象祂，
生活象祂—约壹二 6，三 2，四 17 下。

四 这位神人复制的第一步，乃是我们必须在我们
的灵里，由是灵的基督，以祂神圣的生命和性
情所重生—约三 3，6。
五 为着这位神人的复制，我们需要在我们的魂里被
是灵的基督变化，以祂神圣的属性拔高、加强、
丰富、并充满我们人性的美德，使祂在我们的人
性里得着彰显—林后三 17 ～ 18，罗十二 2。
六 我们需要看见，我们是从神而生的神人，有神
的生命和性情，属于神的种类—约一 12 ～ 13：
1 我们这些神的儿女，由神用神圣的生命所生，乃是
神人，神圣的人；我们与生我们的那位一样—约壹
三 1，五 1。
2 我们既然已由神而生，就可以说我们在生命和性
情上是神，只是无分于神格—约一 12 ～ 13，罗八
16，彼后一 4。
3 想到自己是神人，认识且领悟自己是谁，会使我们
在日常的经历中有革命性的改变—约壹二 20，三 1 ～
2，五 13，20。
4 我们不仅仅是基督徒，或在基督里的信徒；我们乃
是神人，神人类，神的复制—约十二 24，罗八 16，
29，来二 10 ～ 11。

【周六】

2. The many grains, as the many God-men, are the reproduction of God;
such a reproduction makes God happy because His reproduction looks
like Him, speaks like Him, and lives like Him—1 John 2:6; 3:2; 4:17b.

D. The first step of the reproduction of the God-man is that we must be
reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit with His divine life and
nature—John 3:3, 6.
E. For the reproduction of the God-man, we need to be transformed by
the pneumatic Christ in our soul with His divine attributes to uplift,
strengthen, enrich, and fill our human virtues for His expression in
our humanity—2 Cor. 3:17-18; Rom. 12:2.

F. We need to see that we are God-men, born of God, possessing the life
and nature of God, and belonging to the species of God—John 1:12-13:

1. As children of God, born of God with the divine life, we are God-men,
divine persons; we are the same as the One of whom we are born—1
John 3:1; 5:1.

2. Since we have been born of God, we may say that we are God in life and
in nature but not in the Godhead—John 1:12-13; Rom. 8:16; 2 Pet. 1:4.

3. To think of ourselves as God-men and to know and realize who we are
revolutionizes us in our daily experience—1 John 2:20; 3:1-2; 5:13, 20.

4. We are not merely Christians or believers in Christ; we are God-men,
God-man kind, the reproduction of God—John 12:24; Rom. 8:16, 29; Heb.

God-men—John 14:19; Gal. 2:20:

A. As the reproduction of the God-man, we need to live the life of a Godman—Phil. 1:19-21a; 3:10.

B. Christ’s human living was man living God to express the attributes of
God in the human virtues; His human virtues were filled, mingled, and
saturated with the divine attributes—Luke 1:26-35; 7:11-17; 10:2537; 19:1-10.

C. As the expansion, increase, reproduction, and continuation of the first
God-man, we should live the same kind of life that He lived—1 John 2:6:
1. The Lord’s God-man living set up a model for our God-man living—being
crucified to live so that God might be expressed in humanity—Gal. 2:20.

2. We need to deny ourselves, be conformed to Christ’s death, and magnify
Him by the bountiful supply of His Spirit—Matt. 16:24; Phil. 3:10; 1:1921a.
3. We must reject self-cultivation and condemn the building up of the
natural man; we need to realize that the Christian virtues are related
essentially to the divine life, to the divine nature, and to God Himself—
Gal. 5:22-23.
4. The One who lived the life of a God-man is now the Spirit living in us and
through us; we should not allow anything other than this One to fill us
and occupy us—2 Cor. 3:17; 13:5; Eph. 3:16-19.

D. The Christ in Philippians 1:21a is the God-man in Philippians 2:5-8;
therefore, to live Christ is to live the God-man by the bountiful supply
of the Spirit of Jesus Christ—1:19.
E. When we open ourselves to the Lord, love Him, and desire to be joined
to Him as one, we are filled and possessed by Him and live out the glory
of divinity and the virtues of humanity—1 Cor. 2:9; 6:17; Phil. 4:4-9.

约伯记一章一节说，“乌斯地有一个人名叫约伯；
这人完全且正直，敬畏神，远离恶事。”完全，与

不仅如此，正直也是不弯曲，不偏斜。约伯不仅里

的事乃是彰显神。彰显神比敬畏神和远离恶事更高。
（约伯记生命读经，一一至一二页。）

Job 1:1 says, “There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and
this man was perfect and upright, and he feared God and turned away from
evil.” Being perfect is related to our inner man, and being upright is related
to our outer man. Furthermore, to be upright means that we are not crooked
or biased. In addition to being perfect inwardly and upright outwardly, Job
feared God positively and turned away from evil negatively. However,…God
did not create man merely to fear Him without doing anything wrong. The
Bible tells us that God created man in His own image and after His likeness
that man may express Him (Gen. 1:26). This is the most positive thing among
all positive things….The most positive thing is to express God. To express God
is higher than fearing God and turning away from evil. (Life-study of Job, p. 9)

It was not easy for God to gain a person like Job who feared God and
turned away from evil. Yet what Job had attained was altogether vanity. It did
not fulfill God’s purpose, and it did not satisfy God’s desire. Thus, God was
lovingly concerned for Job. Ethically speaking, Job was very good. According
to human eyes, there was no problem with Job. God even boasted to Satan
regarding how good Job was (v. 8; 2:3). Only God knew that Job had a need,
that he was short of God.

Eventually, God’s intention was to make Job a man of God (1 Tim. 6:11; 2
Tim. 3:17), filled with Christ, the embodiment of God, to be the fullness of
God for the expression of God in Christ, not a man of the high standard of
ethics in Job’s natural perfection, natural uprightness, and natural integrity,
which Job attempted to maintain and hold (Job 2:3, 9a). Such a person,
constituted with God according to His economy, would never be entangled by
any troubles and problems so that he would curse his birth and prefer to die
rather than to live.
In His economy God’s intention is to dispense Himself into us to be our life
and our nature that we may be the same as He is in life and nature in order to
express Him….God’s stripping and God’s consuming are to tear us down. We
are fallen and natural men. As such men, we need to be torn down…. Then
God can have a base, a way, to build us up again.
In His economy God’s intention is not to make fallen man whole. Rather,
God’s intention is to tear us down and rebuild us with Himself as our life and
our nature that we may be persons who are absolutely one with Him.

God’s stripping and consuming were exercised over Job to tear Job down
that God might have a base and a way to rebuild him with God Himself that
he might become a God-man. (Life-study of Job, pp. 9-10, 17, 10-11, 29, 3435)

I became greatly excited. I wanted to tell everyone that I had God in me, that
God was my contents. God is my life, my holiness, my love, my slowness, and
my everything. I am a vessel, a container, to contain God and to be filled with
God.
Do not try in yourself to love others. The more you try to love others, the
more you will eventually hate others. If you try to be humble, you will be
proud. You may even have the inward attitude—”Don’t you know that I am so
humble?” This is pride. You are proud of your humility.

In the garden of Eden there were two trees—the tree of life and the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:9). Evil always goes with good. Hatred
goes with love. Pride goes with humility….God wants life. God does not want
you to be a good man, but God wants you to be a God-man….You can never
be an expression of God if you are merely a good man. God made man in His
own image for the purpose of expressing God. When we become a God-man
who is filled with God, we express God. A God-man is an expression of God.

Such a God-man, expressing God, is God’s representative. He represents
God, and he has God’s authority over all things. God created man in His own
image to express Him, and God gave His dominion to man that man may
reign for Him (Gen. 1:26). It is not a good man but a God-man who expresses
God and represents God. God’s image is for us to express God, and God’s
dominion is for us to represent God. We have God Himself in our spirit, and
we can be filled with God and full of God to express Him and represent Him
as a God-man. This is the dispensing of God Himself into us according to the
divine economy. I must testify that my only burden and my unique interest
is God’s economy. God wants to dispense Himself into us to make us Godmen, not good men. A Christian is not merely a good man but a God-man. We
were made in God’s image with a spirit to receive God into us as our life, our
life supply, and our everything to be our very contents for us to be God-men.

being dispensed into us is a composition of the divine nature with its divine
attributes and the human nature with its human virtues. While He was on
earth, He lived a life that was a composition of these two. From the time of
His resurrection He has been seeking to live in the believers the kind of life
He lived on earth. This means that within us today Christ is still living a life
that is a composition of the divine nature with its divine attributes and the
human nature with its human virtues. If we see this, we shall say with Paul,
“It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me” (Gal. 2:20). (The
Conclusion of the New Testament, pp. 655-656)

In the Man-Savior’s God-man living, man’s virtues became a shell, an image,
to express God’s attributes so that God may be expressed in man’s living.
From this we see that our human virtues—our love, brightness, holiness, and
righteousness—are just a shell, the image created by God [Gen. 1:26]. If we
see this, we shall have the answer to the question… concerning why it was
necessary for the Lord Jesus to live on earth for thirty-three and a half years
before He died to accomplish redemption. If He had lived on earth only a
short time, there would have been only a momentary expression of the divine
attributes in His living….The Man-Savior lived a full human life for thirtythree and a half years. During those years He was proved to be without defect
or imperfection. He did not fail in any way. His virtues were an image for an
expression of God’s attributes. Therefore, God was expressed in His living.

The Lord’s God-man living…constituted a prototype to His believers….This
prototype is for the “mass production,” the reproduction, of the God-man
in the believers. In a factory, a great deal of time may be spent to produce a
prototype,… [which is] then used for mass production. In a similar way, the
Man-Savior’s God-man living constituted Him a prototype so that He may
now be reproduced in us. (Life-study of Luke, pp. 525-526)

候，祂所过的生活不是凭祂属人的生命，乃是凭祂神圣
的生命。祂是神圣的，祂要成为人，祂也成了人，但祂
所过的人性生活，却不是凭着祂的人性，乃是凭着祂的
神性。祂是带着神性而来的一个人，祂活在地上不仅是
神，也是人。祂是个神人，但不是凭人的生命活着，乃
是凭神的生命活着。所以祂的人性生活不是凭属人的生
命活出来，乃是凭神圣的生命活出来的；但是在神圣的
生命里，有人性的元素，并且在属人的生命里，有神性
的元素。神圣的属性成了人性的美德。（过照着圣经中
神圣启示高峰之生活实行的路，二四页。）

God desired to become a man, and one day He became a man, living on
earth as a God-man. Yet when He lived on earth as the God-man, He did
not live by His human life but by His divine life. He was divine. He wanted
to become human, and He was human. Yet He lived a human life not by His
humanity but by His divinity. He was a human being who came with divinity.
He lived on this earth not only as God but also as man. He lived as a God-man,
yet not by the life of man but by the life of God. So His human living was not
lived out by the human life but by the divine life. Yet within the divine life
there was the element of humanity, and within the human life there was the
element of divinity. The divine attributes became the human virtues. (CWWL,
1994-1997, vol. 2, “The Practical Way to Live a Life according to the High
Peak of the Divine Revelation in the Holy Scriptures,” pp. 52-53)

[The incarnation of God] produced a God-man, who lived on the earth not
by His human life but by His divine life. All the days when He was on earth,
He put Himself on the cross. He remained on the cross to die that He might
live by God, not to express man but to express God in His divine attributes
becoming man’s virtues. This was the life of the first God-man as a prototype.
Today we are His reproduction, His many copies, so we should live the same
kind of life.

Intrinsically speaking, to follow Jesus is to be a xerox copy of that first
God-man. To follow Jesus is to live the life of a God-man, not by the human
life but by the divine life, so that God may be expressed, or manifested, in
the flesh in all His divine attributes becoming the human virtues…. So the
practical way to live a life according to the high peak of the divine revelation
is that you must be a God-man. As a God-man, you need to live a life not by
yourself but by another One, not by your human life but by His divine life, not
to express yourself but to express His divinity in His divine attributes, which
all become your human virtues.

Christ lived a life of humanity, not by His human life but by His divine
life…. He died to live. He was dying every day during His whole life of thirtythree and a half years. He died to Himself that He might live to the Father
(John 5:19, 30; 8:28). Christ was under the cross all the time on the earth,
expressing not Himself but the Father. One day Philip asked Him, “Lord,
show us the Father…” (John 14:8). The Lord responded, “Have I been so long
a time with you, and you have not known Me…? He who has seen Me has
seen the Father…” (v. 9). The disciples saw the Lord Jesus, but when they
saw Him, they saw the Father. This shows that He was the expression of the
Father.

Christ made Himself, the first God-man, a prototype for the mass
reproduction of many brothers, the many God-men (Rom. 8:29). I have been
a Christian for about sixty-nine years. After so many years I have been made
by God to know only one thing—God became man so that man may become
God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. This is my unique burden,
my unique message. God and man will become one entity, and that one entity
is the mingling of divinity with humanity. This mingling will consummate
in the New Jerusalem, which is the conclusion of the entire Bible. (CWWL,
1994-1997, vol. 2, “The Practical Way to Live a Life according to the High
Peak of the Divine Revelation in the Holy Scriptures,” pp. 53-55)

约十二 24“我实实在在地告诉你们，一粒麦子不
落在地里死了，仍旧是一粒；若是死了，就结
出许多子粒来。”

John 12:24 Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into
the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.

罗八 16“那灵自己同我们的灵见证我们是神的儿

Rom. 8:16 The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are
children of God.

我们的第二个出生，使我们得进神的国，成为神
的种类。动物和植物都有其特别的种类。我们是从
神而生，所以我们是众神，属于神的种类。我们应
当一直记得，我们是神人，属于神的种类。

Our second birth caused us to enter into the kingdom of God to become
the species of God. The animals and plants have their particular species. We
are born of God, so we are gods belonging to the species of God. We should
always remember that we are God-men belonging to the species of God.

我们既是从神而生的神人，且属于神的种类，我
们对自己的配偶说话时，就不可随便。作丈夫的必
须是神人，生活象神人。只是作好人，离神的喜悦
太远了。我们必须看见，我们是神人，从神而生，

主耶稣这神人说，祂是一粒麦子要落在地里死

实际上就是许多的神，作神的复制。头一个子粒—
第一个神人—是原型，由这一子粒借着死与复活所
产生的许多子粒—许多神人—是大量复制。这是神
的复制。有些人听见神被复制，也许感到震惊，…
然而，这正是约翰十二章二十四节所启示的。
神真正的嗜好是要在全地许多国家得着祂的复

As God-men born of God and belonging to God’s species, we cannot speak
to our spouse in a loose way. A husband must be a God-man, living as a Godman. To be merely a good man is far away from God’s good pleasure. We need
to see that we are God-men, born of God and belonging to God’s species. This
is the beginning of the God-man living. (CWWL, 1994-1997, vol. 3, “The Godman Living,” p. 448)

Today’s Reading

The Lord Jesus, the God-man, said that He was a grain of wheat falling into the
ground to die in order to become many grains (John 12:24). These many grains
are actually many gods as the reproduction of God. The first grain—the first Godman—was a prototype, and the many grains—the many God-men—produced by
this one grain through death and resurrection are the mass reproduction. This
is the reproduction of God. When some hear that God has been reproduced, they
may be shocked…. Nevertheless, this is what is revealed in John 12:24.

God’s real hobby is to have His reproduction in many nations around the
globe. Such a reproduction makes God happy because His reproduction looks
like Him, speaks like Him, and lives like Him. God is in this reproduction, and
His reproduction has His life, His nature, and His constitution.

虽然我们是神的复制，但这复制—神的嗜好—不是
这样完整或完全，因为我们许多有神生命的人，没有
凭祂的生命而活。有些人的确凭神的生命而活，但他
们没有不断凭祂的生命而活。可能早晨他们凭神的生
命而活，但后来他们发了脾气，于是就活得象蝎子。…
晚上他们也许变得更坏，活得象魔鬼撒但。…有一天，
主耶稣转向爱祂的彼得，对他说，“撒但，退我后面
去吧！”（太十六 23 上。）因为彼得成了撒但，他
就需要背起他的十字架，使撒但被置于十字架。
在我们日常的生活中，我们也许有时候是神，有
时候是蝎子，有时候象撒但。因为这是我们实际的
情况，我们当然需要被变化。
自从一九六二年这职事到了美国以来，我实际上
只传讲一件事—神成为人，为要使人在生命和性情
上成为神。然而，直到一九九四年二月，我才得着
这样清楚的看见，有沉重的负担要告诉神的子民，
我们众人都在生命和性情上（但不在神格上）是神。
认识我们是谁，并领悟我们是谁，会使我们有革命
性的改变。假定某位活得象蝎子的弟兄，领悟他是
神的儿女，在生命和性情上是神，这位弟兄立刻会
有彻底的改变。与他有关的气氛和一切也会随之改
变。倘若今天所有的基督徒都领悟，他们在生命和
性情上是神，整个世界都会不一样。已往十个月里，
我常查问自己：“一个神人是这样么？你说信徒已
在生命和性情上成为神，但你现在是什么？你是神
或是别的东西？”我的回答是要悔改，并求主赦免，
因为至少有一些我作的事，不是在祂里面或照着祂
作的。这种领悟使我有革命性的改变。（历代志生

Although we are God’s reproduction, this reproduction—God’s hobby—
is not so complete or perfect, because many of us who have God’s life do
not live by His life. Some do live by God’s life, but they do not live by His life
continually. Perhaps in the morning they live by God’s life, but later in the
day they may lose their temper and live like a scorpion…. In the evening they
may become even worse, living like the devil, Satan….One day the Lord Jesus
turned to Peter, someone who loved Him, and said to him, “Get behind Me,
Satan!” (Matt. 16:23a). Because Peter had become Satan, he needed to bear
his cross so that Satan could be put on the cross.
In our daily living we may be God at one time, a scorpion at another time,
and Satan at yet another time. Because this is our actual situation, we surely
need to be transformed.

Since the ministry began in the United States in 1962, I have actually
ministered only one matter—God becoming a man that man may become
God in life and in nature. However, it was not until February 1994 that I
received such a clear view with a heavy burden to tell God’s people that we
all are God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. To know who we
are and to realize who we are revolutionizes us. Suppose a certain brother
who has been living like a scorpion realizes that, as a child of God, he is God
in life and in nature. Immediately this brother will be radically changed.
The atmosphere and everything related to him will also be changed. If all of
today’s Christians realized that they were God in life and in nature, the whole
world would be different. During the past ten months, I have often checked
with myself: “Is a God-man like this? You have spoken that the believers have
become God in life and in nature, yet what are you now? Are you God or are
you something else?” My answer has been to repent and ask for the Lord’s
forgiveness because at least some of the things I did were not in Him or
according to Him. This realization has revolutionized me. (Life-study of 1 & 2
Chronicles, pp. 11-12)

In Philippians we see how Christ is lived out from us in order to have many
duplicates of Himself. All Christians should be duplicates of the unique Godman.

How can we be such duplicates, such reproductions? First, we need to be
reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit, and then we need to be gradually
transformed by the pneumatic Christ in our soul. Then spontaneously we
shall live Christ, the God-man, by the bountiful supply of His Spirit, taking
His mind and shining the word of life as luminaries reflecting His brightness.
We shall also be found in Christ with Him as our surpassing righteousness,
in the power of His resurrection, and conformed to His death. Then we shall
express Him in all the human virtues created by God for man. With the divine
attributes of the God-man these virtues are strengthened, enriched, and
filled. (Life-study of Luke, p. 543)

Today’s Reading

The Spirit as the extract of Christ contains the element of the highest
standard of morality. As the Spirit moves within us, the element of the
highest human virtues also moves in us. The Lord does not rescue us from
our temper by doing something miraculously…. Instead, He rescues us by
moving in us and mingling Himself with us as the One who indwells us. If
we turn to Him as the One in our spirit and call on His name, He will move

的。（路加福音生命读经，六一六至六一七页。）
我们所传的这位神，经过成为肉体，死而复活，
成了那赐生命的灵。今天祂既是神又是人。当祂来
成为人，活在地上时，祂并没有把神性放弃，…所

我们不只没有神性，连我们的人性也是堕落的。但
我们得救以后，我们不仅有神性，我们也得着了最
高的人性，使我们能过一种高超的生活。我们不是
拘守什么外面的规条，乃是里面多了一个成分，就

就能活出神性一切的荣耀；因着祂的人性，我们就
能活出人性一切的美德。所以一个真正得救，凭着
里面的灵活着的人，在他身上就自然流露出神的荣

我们的主是神，又是人。在全世界所有的传记
中，没有一个人象新约四福音所记载的主耶稣。当
我们读的时候，不仅惊奇祂的神性，更受祂人性的
美德所感动、所吸引。祂的为人、态度、待人实在

一位神而人者，竟然乐意住在我们里面。祂经过成

in us with all His elements. In this way He saves us. (Life-study of Luke, p.
533)

The God whom we preach has become the life-giving Spirit through
incarnation, death, and resurrection. Today He is both God and man. When
He came to be a man and lived on earth, He did not forsake His divinity….
Therefore, some Bible expositors call Him the “God-man.”…The Spirit who
has entered into us possesses not only divinity but also humanity. Before we
were saved, not only were we void of divinity, even our humanity was fallen.
However, from the time we were saved, not only do we possess divinity, but
we also have received the highest humanity for us to live a transcendent
life. We do not merely adhere to outward regulations; rather, we have an
element added to us, and that element is the excellent humanity of the Lord
Jesus Christ…. Because of His divinity we can live out all the glory of divinity,
and because of His humanity we can live out all the virtues of humanity.
Therefore, the glory of God and the virtues of man flow out spontaneously
from one who is truly saved and who lives by the Spirit within him.

Our Lord is both God and man. Of all the biographies of the world, there
is none like that of the Lord Jesus recorded in the four Gospels of the New
Testament. When we read these Gospels, not only do we marvel at His
divinity, but even more we are moved and attracted by His human virtues.
His behavior, His attitude, and the way He treated others were too wonderful;
His humanity is unsurpassed. We praise Him! Such a God-man is pleased to
indwell us. He passed through incarnation, death, and resurrection to become
the life-giving Spirit. Now He is waiting for us to call on Him and believe into
Him. Once we call on His name and receive Him as our Savior, He enters into
us, and thereby we have an organic union with Him. When we open ourselves
to Him, love Him, and desire to be joined with Him as one, we are filled and
possessed by Him every day. In this way what we live out are the glory of
divinity and the virtues of humanity. What a glorious, wonderful, and sweet
life this is! (CWWL, 1983, vol. 3, “The Wonderful Being of Christ,” p. 151)

Outline
§Day 1

壹 神在约伯身上的目的，是要他成为活在属 I. God’s intention with Job was for him to become a person who
lived in the heavenly vision and the reality of God’s economy:
天异象和神经纶实际里的人：
一 约伯的经历乃是神在祂神圣经纶里所采取的一个
步骤，要对自满的约伯实行销毁并剥夺，好将约
伯拆毁，使神能有一条路，用神自己重建约伯，
并将约伯引进对神更深的追求，使他能得着神，
而不是得着神的祝福，或他凭自己的完全和纯全
而有的成就—腓三 10 ～ 14，林前二 9，八 3，
出二十 6，代上十六 10 ～ 11，二二 19 上，代下

二 不在意神的人也许赢得许多事物，并且似乎也兴
旺；（诗七三 1 ～ 15；）然而，在意神的人会
受神限制，甚至被神剥夺许多事物；神对寻求祂
者的目的，是要他们在祂里面得着一切，而不被

A. Job’s experience was a step taken by God in His divine economy to
carry out the consuming and stripping of the contented Job in order
to tear Job down that God might have a way to rebuild him with God
Himself and to usher him into a deeper seeking after God so that he
might gain God instead of His blessings and his attainments in his
perfection and integrity—Phil. 3:10-14; 1 Cor. 2:9; 8:3; Exo. 20:6; 1
Chron. 16:10-11; 22:19a; 2 Chron. 12:14; 26:3-5; 34:1-3a; Psa. 24:6;
27:4, 8; 105:4; 119:2, 10; Heb. 11:6.
B. The one who does not care for God may gain many things and may seem
to prosper (Psa. 73:1-15); however, the one who cares for God will
be restricted by God and even stripped by God of many things; God’s
intention with His seekers is that they may find everything in Him and

打岔离开对祂自己绝对的享受。（16 ～ 28。）
三 神对付祂圣民的目的，乃是要使他们倒空一切，
单单接受神，作他们所赢得的；（腓三 8，参诗
七三 25 ～ 26；）神心头的愿望乃是要我们完满
地得着祂作生命，作生命的供应，并作我们全人
的一切。（罗八 10，6，11，参西一 17 下，18 下。）
四 我们要活在神经纶的实际同祂神圣的分赐里，
就需要神将祂自己建造到我们内在的构成里，
使我们全人被基督重新构成：
1 如保罗的书信所揭示的，神对付我们的目的，乃是
要剥夺我们一切的事物，并销毁我们，好叫我们更
多得着神—林后四 16 ～ 18。
2 召会的建造，是借着基督安家在我们心里，就是借
着祂将自己建造到我们里面，使我们的心，我们内
里的构成，成为祂的家—弗三 16 ～ 21。

五 在基督里，神构成到人里面，人也构成到神里
面，神与人调和在一起成为一个实体，就是这
位神人；这含示神在祂经纶里的目的，是要使
祂自己成为人，为要使人在生命和性情上成为
神，但无分于神格—撒下七 12 ～ 14 上，罗一 3 ～
4，太二二 41 ～ 45，约十四 6 上，十 10 下，林
前十五 45 下，约六 63，林后三 6，约壹五 16 上。

【周二】

not be distracted from the absolute enjoyment of Himself (vv. 16-28).

C. God’s purpose in dealing with His holy people is that they would be
emptied of everything and receive only God as their gain (Phil. 3:8; cf.
Psa. 73:25-26); the desire of God’s heart is that we would gain Him in
full as life, as the life supply, and as everything to our being (Rom. 8:10,
6, 11; cf. Col. 1:17b, 18b).

D. In order to live in the reality of God’s economy with His divine
dispensing, we need God to build Himself into our intrinsic
constitution so that our entire being will be reconstituted with Christ:
1. As unveiled in Paul’s Epistles, God’s purpose in dealing with us is to strip
us of all things and to consume us so that we may gain God more and
more—2 Cor. 4:16-18.
2. The building up of the church is by Christ’s making His home in our
hearts, that is, by His building Himself into us, making our heart, our
intrinsic constitution, His home—Eph. 3:16-21.

E. In Christ God was constituted into man, man was constituted into
God, and God and man were mingled together to be one entity, the
God-man; this implies that God’s intention in His economy is to
make Himself man in order to make man God in life and in nature
but not in the Godhead—2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Rom. 1:3-4; Matt. 22:4145; John 14:6a; 10:10b; 1 Cor. 15:45b; John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6; 1 John
5:16a.

贰 神的经纶乃是神借着成为肉体，成为在肉 II. God’s economy is God becoming a man in the flesh through

一 永远并三一的神成为人，所经过最奇妙、超越、奥
秘、并包罗万有的变化，乃是神在人里面的行动，
为着完成祂永远的经纶—弥五 2，约一 14，29，三
14，十二 24，徒十三 33，彼前一 3，林前十五 45 下，
徒二 36，五 31，来四 14，九 15，七 22，八 2：
1 这些变化是三一神成为一个神人所经过的过程，将
神性带进人性里，使神性与人性调和，作为原型，
以大量复制许多神人；祂成了三一神具体的化身，
将神带给人，使神成为可接触、可摸着、可接受、
可经历、可进入、并可享受的—约一 14，西二 9，
罗八 28 ～ 29。

【周三】
2 在何西阿十一章四节神说到这些变化，说，“我用
慈绳爱索牵引他们；”“慈绳〔直译，人的绳〕爱索”
这辞指明神用祂神圣的爱爱我们，不是在神性的水
平上，乃是在人性的水平上；神的爱是神圣的，却
是在人的绳里，也就是借着基督的人性，临到我们：
a 神所借以牵引我们的绳子（种种的变化，种种的过
程），包括基督的成为肉体、人性生活、钉死、复活
和升天；借着基督在祂人性里的这一切步骤，神在祂
救恩里的爱才临到我们—耶三一 3，约三 14，16，六
44，十二 32，罗五 5，8，约壹四 8 ～ 10，16，19。
b 在基督之外，神永远长存的爱，就是祂不变、征服
人的爱，在我们身上就无法得胜；神不变的爱是得
胜的，因为这爱是在基督里、同着基督、借着基督、
并为着基督的。
c 神永远长存的爱总是得胜的；虽然我们有失败和错
误，神的爱终必得胜—罗八 35 ～ 39。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 6 周纲要 - 第 3 页

A. The most marvelous, excellent, mysterious, and all-inclusive
transformations of the eternal and Triune God in His becoming a
man are God’s move in man for the accomplishment of His eternal
economy—Micah 5:2; John 1:14, 29; 3:14; 12:24; Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3;
1 Cor. 15:45b; Acts 2:36; 5:31; Heb. 4:14; 9:15; 7:22; 8:2:

1. These transformations are the processes through which the Triune God
passed in His becoming a God-man, bringing divinity into humanity and
mingling divinity with humanity as a prototype for the mass reproduction
of many God-men; He became the embodiment of the Triune God,
bringing God to man and making God contactable, touchable, receivable,
experienceable, enterable, and enjoyable—John 1:14; Col. 2:9; Rom. 8:28-29.

§Day 3

2. God speaks of these transformations in Hosea 11:4 by saying, “I drew them
with cords of a man, / With bands of love”; the phrase with cords of a man,
with bands of love indicates that God loves us with His divine love not on
the level of divinity but on the level of humanity; God’s love is divine, but it
reaches us in the cords of a man, that is, through Christ’s humanity:
a. The cords (the transformations, the processes) through which God draws
us include Christ’s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and
ascension; it is by all these steps of Christ in His humanity that God’s love in
His salvation reaches us—Jer. 31:3; John 3:14, 16; 6:44; 12:32; Rom. 5:5, 8; 1
John 4:8-10, 16, 19.
b. Apart from Christ, God’s everlasting love, His unchanging, subduing love,
could not be prevailing in relation to us; God’s unchanging love is prevailing
because it is a love in Christ, with Christ, by Christ, and for Christ.

c. God’s everlasting love is always victorious; eventually, in spite of our failures
and mistakes, God’s love will gain the victory—Rom. 8:35-39.

【周四】
二 三部分之人的变化，乃是神的行动，要使人成为
神，使人被经过过程并终极完成的三一神所构
成；在神向约伯的显现中，约伯看见了神，使他
得着神，好为着神的目的被神变化—伯三八 1 ～
3，四二 1 ～ 6，林后三 16 ～ 18，来十二 1 ～ 2 上：
1 看见神的结果是我们被变化成为神的形像；因此，
我们越在灵里观看祂这终极完成的灵，就越将祂
一切的成分作为神圣的元素接受到我们里面，以排
除我们老旧的元素，使我们全人成为新的；我们的
基督徒生活不在于外面的改变，乃在于从里面被变
化—林后三 18，诗二七 4，加六 15 ～ 16。
2 我们借着心转向主，以没有帕子遮蔽的脸观看并返
照祂，就能天天留在变化的过程中；没有帕子遮蔽
的脸就是转向主的心—林后三 16，18：
a 心转向主，就是爱主；我们越爱主，我们的心向主
就越敞开，祂就有路从我们的灵扩展到我们心的各
部分。
b 心转向主，把心向主敞开，是我们生命长大的秘诀；
我们可以借着简单的告诉主：“主啊，我爱你，我
要讨你喜悦，”而向主敞开我们的心。
c 我们一天过一天在一切的境遇中观看主，（诗二七
4，）就返照主的荣光，并渐渐变化成为主的形像，
从荣耀到荣耀。
d 许多基督徒不喜乐，因为他们里面的圣灵不喜乐；
（弗四 30，参诗十六 11，四三 4，徒三 19 ～ 20，
出三三 11，14 ～ 17，来一 9，耶十五 16，约十五 9 ～
11，约壹一 3 ～ 4，约贰 12，腓四 4；）我们的心

§Day 4

B. The transformation of the tripartite man is God’s move to deify man,
to constitute man with the processed and consummated Triune God;
in God’s appearing to him, Job saw God in order to gain God to be
transformed by God for the purpose of God—Job 38:1-3; 42:1-6; 2
Cor. 3:16-18; Heb. 12:1-2a:

1. Seeing God issues in the transformation of our being into God’s image;
hence, the more we look at Him as the consummated Spirit in our spirit,
the more we receive all His ingredients into our being as the divine
element to discharge our old element so that our whole being becomes
new; our Christian life is not a matter of changing outwardly but of being
transformed from within—2 Cor. 3:18; Psa. 27:4; Gal. 6:15-16.
2. We can remain in the daily process of transformation by turning our
heart to the Lord so that we can behold and reflect Him with an unveiled
face; an unveiled face is a heart that turns to the Lord—2 Cor. 3:16, 18:

a. To turn our heart to the Lord is to love the Lord; the more we love the Lord,
the more our heart will be open to the Lord, and He will have a way to spread
out from our spirit into all the parts of our heart.

b. To turn our heart to the Lord, to open our heart to the Lord, is the key to our
growing in life; we can open our heart to the Lord simply by telling the Lord, “O
Lord, I love You; I want to please You.”
c. As we behold the Lord day after day in all our situations (Psa. 27:4), we will
reflect the Lord’s glory and be transformed into His image from glory to
glory.

d. Many Christians are not joyful because the Spirit within them is not joyful
(Eph. 4:30; cf. Psa. 16:11; 43:4; Acts 3:19-20; Exo. 33:11, 14-17; Heb. 1:9; Jer.
15:16; John 15:9-11; 1 John 1:3-4; 2 John 12; Phil. 4:4); if we do not turn our
heart to the Lord to let the Spirit of the Lord spread out of our spirit into our
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 6 - Page 4

若不转向主，不让主的灵从我们的灵扩展到我们的
心里，我们定规是拘束、下沉的。
e 主的灵在哪里，哪里就有自由；（林后三 17；）若
有人说聚会沉闷，我们就要领悟是他自己里面沉闷；
然而当我们的心转向主，我们就享受那灵作我们的
自由。
f 释放的灵一有路扩展到我们心的各部分，我们就得
释放、超脱且自由；这自由就是荣耀，就是神的同
在和神的显出；我们觉得高尚、尊贵、光荣，因为
我们正在被变化成为祂的形像—18 节，创一 26。

【周五】
三 变化使我们从一个形状，就是旧人的形状，迁
移到另一个形状，就是新人的形状；主乃是借
着基督之死的杀死来完成这变化的工作—林后
四 10 ～ 12，16 ～ 18：
1 在林后四章十节保罗说，我们身体上常带着耶稣的
治死；“治死”的意思是杀死；基督的死杀死我们—
林前十五 31，36，约十二 24 ～ 26，林后一 8 ～ 9。
2 基督的死乃是在复合的灵里；那灵是基督之死及其
功效的应用—出三十 22 ～ 25，罗八 13。
3 基督徒的生活乃是一直在复合之灵的治死下的生
活；这种每天的治死是由内住之灵以环境为治死的
器械所完成的。
4 在神的神圣和主宰的安排之下，万有都互相效力，
借着基督之死的杀死使我们变化，叫我们得益处；
罗马八章二十八节里的“益处”，与物质的人事物
无关；只有一位是有益处的，就是神—路十八 19：
a 一切与我们有关的人事物，都是圣灵作工叫我们得
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 6 周纲要 - 第 5 页

heart, we will feel restrained and depressed.

e. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom (2 Cor. 3:17); if someone
says that a meeting is boring, we must realize that it is he himself who is
bored within; but when we turn our heart to the Lord, we enjoy the Spirit as
our freedom.

f. Once the liberating Spirit has the way to spread into all the parts of our heart,
we are released, transcendent, and free; this freedom is glory, which is the
presence of God and the expression of God; we feel noble, honorable, and
glorious because we are being transformed into His image—v. 18; Gen. 1:26.

§Day 5

C. Transformation transfers us from one form, the form of the old man,
to another form, the form of the new man; the Lord accomplishes this
transformation work by the killing of Christ’s death—2 Cor. 4:10-12,
16-18:
1. In 2 Corinthians 4:10 Paul says that we are always bearing about in our
body the putting to death of Jesus; putting to death means killing; the
death of Christ kills us—1 Cor. 15:31, 36; John 12:24-26; 2 Cor. 1:8-9.

2. The death of Christ is in the compound Spirit; the Spirit is the application
of the death of Christ and its effectiveness—Exo. 30:22-25; Rom. 8:13.

3. The Christian life is a life that is all the time under the killing by the
compound Spirit; this daily killing is carried out by the indwelling Spirit
with the environment as the killing weapon.
4. Under God’s divine and sovereign arrangement, everything works for
our good, for our transformation, through the killing of Christ’s death;
the “good” in Romans 8:28 is not related to physical persons, matters, or
things; only One is good—God—Luke 18:19:

a. All persons, all matters, and all things related to us are the means of the Holy
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 6 - Page 5

益处的凭借，好加给我们美福，（诗六八 19 上，）
就是三一神自己。（参创四五 5，五十 20。）
b 一切与我们有关的人和处境，都是神的灵所安排
的，为要配合祂在我们里面的工作，使我们变化并
模成神长子的形像—参太十 29 ～ 31。

四 我们经历圣灵的管治时，变化就在我们里面进
行—罗八 2，28 ～ 29，来十二 5 ～ 14：
1 那灵在我们里面的工作，是为我们构成新的所是，
但那灵外面的工作是借着我们的环境，拆毁我们天
然所是的每一面—参耶四八 11。
2 我们应当与内里运行的灵合作，并接受神为我们所
安排的环境—腓四 12，弗三 1，四 1，六 20，林前
七 24。

【周六】

Spirit to work good for us so that we can be loaded with good (Psa. 68:19a),
with the Triune God Himself (cf. Gen. 45:5; 50:20).

b. All persons and all situations related to us are arranged by the Spirit of God
to match His work within us so that we may be transformed and conformed
to the image of the firstborn Son of God—cf. Matt. 10:29-31.

D. Transformation is carried out in us as we experience the discipline of
the Holy Spirit—Rom. 8:2, 28-29; Heb. 12:5-14:
1. The work of the Spirit within us is to constitute a new being for us, but
the work of the Spirit without is to tear down every aspect of our natural
being through our environment—cf. Jer. 48:11.

2. We should cooperate with the inner operating Spirit and accept the
environment that God has arranged for us—Phil. 4:12; Eph. 3:1; 4:1; 6:20;
1 Cor. 7:24.

§Day 6

叁 职事是由启示加上苦难所产生的；我们所 III. Ministry is the issue of revelation plus suffering—what we
see is wrought into us through suffering; hence, what we

此，我们所供应的乃是我们的所是：
一 执事的人数虽多，但只有一个职事，就是为着
成就神新约经纶的新约职事；我们与基督同工，
乃是要完成这唯一的职事，将基督供应人，以
建造祂的身体—徒一 17，弗四 11 ～ 12，提前
一 12，林后四 1，六 1 上。

二 整体而言，身体有一个唯一的团体职事，但因
这职事乃是基督身体的事奉，而且因着身体有
许多肢体，所以众肢体都有各自的职事，为着
完成那唯一的职事—徒二十 24，二一 19，提后
四 5，西四 17。

A. Although the ministers are many, they have only one ministry—the
ministry of the new covenant for the accomplishing of God’s New
Testament economy; our working together with Christ is to carry out
this unique ministry, the ministering of Christ to people for the building
up of His Body—Acts 1:17; Eph. 4:11-12; 1 Tim. 1:12; 2 Cor. 4:1; 6:1a.

B. As a whole, the Body has one, unique corporate ministry, but because
this ministry is the service of the Body of Christ and because the Body
has many members, all the members have their own ministry for the
carrying out of the unique ministry—Acts 20:24; 21:19; 2 Tim. 4:5;
Col. 4:17.
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 6 - Page 6

三 这职事是为着供应我们所经历的基督，并且是
由对基督之丰富的经历，经过受苦、消耗的压
力、以及十字架杀死的工作而构成、产生并形
成的—徒九 15 ～ 16，西一 24，腓三 10，提前
四 6，林后一 4 ～ 6，8 ～ 9，12，三 3，6：
1 那灵的职事使我们供应基督作那赐人生命的灵，我
们借此就达到神圣启示的高峰—8 ～ 9，6，3 节，
启二二 17 上。
2 义的职事使我们供应基督不仅作我们客观的义，也
作我们主观活出的义，使基督得着真正的彰显，
我们借此就进入神人的生活—罗五 17，腓三 9，启
十九 8。
3 和好的职事使我们供应基督作和好的话语，好能将
神的子民带到他们的灵，就是至圣所里，使他们成
为在灵里的人，我们借此就在基督那牧养人的天上
职事里与基督是一，按着神牧养人—林后五 18 ～
20，约二一 15 ～ 17，彼前五 2 ～ 4，二 25，启一
12 ～ 13，来十 19，22，林前二 15。
4 我们完全进入这样一个美妙职事的三方面，主就有
路带众召会进入一个新的复兴。

四 患难是恩典连同基督一切丰富的甜美眷临和化
身；恩典主要是以患难的样式眷临我们—林后
十二 7 ～ 10：
1 借着患难，基督的十字架在我们天然所是上治死的
功效，就借着圣灵应用在我们身上，使复活的神有
路将祂自己加到我们里面—一 8 ～ 9，四 16 ～ 18。
2 患难生忍耐，忍耐产生蒙称许的品质—蒙称许的品
质或属性，是忍受并经历患难和试验的结果—罗五
3 ～ 4。

C. The ministry is for ministering the Christ whom we have experienced,
and it is constituted with, and produced and formed by, the
experiences of the riches of Christ gained through sufferings,
consuming pressures, and the killing work of the cross—Acts 9:15-16;
Col. 1:24; Phil. 3:10; 1 Tim. 4:6; 2 Cor. 1:4-6, 8-9, 12; 3:3, 6:
1. The ministry of the Spirit is for us to arrive at the high peak of the divine
revelation by our ministering Christ as the Spirit, who gives life—vv. 8-9,
6, 3; Rev. 22:17a.
2. The ministry of righteousness is for us to enter into the God-man living
by our ministering Christ not only as our objective righteousness but also
as our subjective and lived-out righteousness for the genuine expression
of Christ—Rom. 5:17; Phil. 3:9; Rev. 19:8.

3. The ministry of reconciliation is for us to shepherd people according to
God (in oneness with Christ in His heavenly ministry of shepherding) by
our ministering Christ as the word of reconciliation so that we can bring
God’s people into their spirit as the Holy of Holies for them to become
persons in the spirit—2 Cor. 5:18-20; John 21:15-17; 1 Pet. 5:2-4; 2:25;
Rev. 1:12-13; Heb. 10:19, 22; 1 Cor. 2:15.
4. By our fully entering into such a wonderful ministry in its three aspects,
the Lord will have a way to bring the churches into a new revival.

D. Tribulation is the sweet visitation and incarnation of grace with all the
riches of Christ; grace visits us mainly in the form of tribulation—2
Cor. 12:7-10:
1. Through tribulations the killing effect of the cross of Christ on our natural
being is applied to us by the Holy Spirit, making the way for the God of
resurrection to add Himself into us—1:8-9; 4:16-18.
2. Tribulation produces endurance, which brings forth the quality of
approvedness—an approved quality or attribute resulting from the
enduring and experiencing of tribulation and testing—Rom. 5:3-4.

E. God poured out Himself as love in our hearts with the Holy Spirit, who
has been given to us, as the motivating power within us, that we may
more than conquer in all our tribulations; therefore, when we endure
any kind of tribulation, we are not put to shame but live Christ for His
magnification—v. 5; 8:31-39; 2 Cor. 5:14-15; Phil. 1:19-21a.

one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching
forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the
prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward.

约伯的三个朋友说不出话来，因为他们不认识、
不明白发生在约伯身上的事，目的是什么。这里的
景象指明，约伯和他的三个朋友，对所发生的那极
痛苦、极可怕的事毫不明白，而在他们的敬虔中感
到困惑，无法洞悉其原因是什么，其目的是什么，
其结果将如何。实际上，约伯的经历乃是神在祂神
圣经纶里所采取的一个步骤，要对自满的约伯实行
销毁并剥夺，好将约伯引进对神更深的追求，使他
能得着神，而不是得着神的祝福，或他凭自己的完
全和纯全而有的成就。神在约伯身上施行剥夺和销
毁，好将他拆毁，使神能有一个根据和一条路，用
神自己重建约伯，使他成为神人，在生命和性情上
与神一样（但无分于祂的神格），好彰显神。（圣
经恢复本，伯二 13 注 1。）

Job’s three friends could not speak anything because they had no
knowledge, no understanding, concerning the purpose of what had
happened to Job. The scene here indicates that Job and his friends were
ignorant concerning that most painful and most terrifying occurrence, and
were puzzled in their godliness, unable to discern what the reason was, what
the purpose was, and what the result would be. Actually, Job’s experience
was a step taken by God in His divine economy to carry out the consuming
and stripping of the contented Job in order to usher Job into a deeper seeking
after God, that he might gain God instead of His blessings and his attainments
in his perfection and integrity. God’s stripping and consuming were exercised
over Job to tear Job down that God might have a base and a way to rebuild
him with God Himself that he might become a God-man, the same as God in
His life and nature but not in His Godhead, in order to express God. (Job 2:13,

Today’s Reading

The divine revelation in the Bible is progressive. Up to Job’s time the
progression of the divine revelation had reached only the level of Abraham’s
time, that is, that sinners need God’s redemption with the shedding of the
blood of the burnt offering (Job 1:5; 42:8). The divine truths regarding such
matters as regeneration (John 3:6; 1 Pet. 1:23), renewing (2 Cor. 4:16…),

（八 29、）和得荣（23，30…）等事的神圣真理，
在神旧约的经纶里，还没有明确地启示给人。神无
法向约伯和他的朋友讲说这些事，因为他们是在神
圣启示的原始阶段。（参约三 7 ～ 12，十六 12 ～
13。）这些事乃是直到使徒保罗的时候，才完整地
启示出来。关于约伯和他朋友所不明白之事，保罗
领受了完满且明确的启示。（弗三 3 ～ 6，9 ～ 11，
西一 25 ～ 27。）若没有保罗的书信，就难以明白约
伯记，因为关于神对付祂子民的目的，约伯记的结
语并没有给我们明确的观点。然而，按新约的观点
就非常清楚，神对付祂圣民的目的，乃是要使他们
倒空一切，单单接受神，作他们所赢得的。（腓三 8，
参诗七三 25 ～ 26。）神心头的愿望乃是要我们完满
地得着祂作生命，作生命的供应，并作我们全人的
一切。（圣经恢复本，伯二 13 注 1。）
〔诗篇七十六篇二十六节提到，〕在神的圣所里，
诗人受指教单单以神自己，而不是神以外的任何事
物，为他的业分。不在意神的人也许赢得许多事物，
并且似乎也兴旺。然而，在意神的人会受神限制，甚
至被神剥夺许多事物，正如约伯（伯一 6 ～二 10）
和使徒保罗（腓三 7 ～ 8）的例子一样。神对寻求祂
者的目的，是要他们在祂里面得着一切，而不被打岔
离开对祂自己绝对的享受。这不是遵行律法的问题，
象在诗篇一篇所说者，也不是对错的问题，乃是得着
神并持守神作一切的问题。（诗七三 26 注 1。）
约伯记写于神圣启示进展的早期，…所以没有清
楚启示神对付祂子民的目的。这启示没有给约伯，
乃是给了保罗。保罗的书信揭示，神对付我们的目
的，乃是要剥夺我们一切的事物，并销毁我们，好
叫我们更多得着神。（腓三 8，林后四 16。）（伯
一 1 注 1。）

transformation (Rom. 12:2…), conformation (8:29), and glorification (vv. 23,
30…) were not explicitly revealed to man in God’s Old Testament economy.
God could not speak such things to Job and his friends because they were in
a primitive stage of the divine revelation (cf. John 3:7-12; 16:12-13). These
things were not revealed in completion until the apostle Paul’s time. Paul
received a full and explicit revelation of things concerning which Job and his
friends had no understanding (Eph. 3:3-6, 9-11; Col. 1:25-27). Without the
Epistles of Paul it would be difficult to understand the book of Job, because
the conclusion of Job does not give us an explicit view concerning the
purpose of God’s dealing with His people. However, in the view of the New
Testament it is very clear that God’s purpose in dealing with His holy people
is that they would be emptied of everything and receive only God as their
gain (Phil. 3:8; cf. Psa. 73:25-26). The desire of God’s heart is that we would
gain Him in full as life, as the life supply, and as everything to our being. (Job
2:13, footnote 1)
In God’s sanctuary the psalmist was instructed to take only God
Himself as his portion, not anything other than God. The one who does
not care for God may gain many things and seem to prosper. However, the
one who cares for God will be restricted by God and even stripped by God
of many things, as was the case with Job (Job 1:6—2:10) and the apostle
Paul (Phil. 3:7-8). God’s intention with His seekers is that they may find
everything in Him and not be distracted from the absolute enjoyment of
Himself. It is not a matter of keeping the law, as in Psalm 1, or of being
right or wrong, but of gaining God and keeping God as everything. (Psa.
73:26, footnote 1)

The book of Job, written early in the progression of the divine revelation…,
does not contain a clear revelation of God’s purpose in dealing with His
people. This revelation was given not to Job but to Paul. As unveiled in Paul’s
Epistles, God’s purpose in dealing with us is to strip us of all things and to
consume us so that we may gain God more and more (Phil. 3:8; 2 Cor. 4:16).

We want to see the most marvelous, excellent, mysterious, and allinclusive transformations of the eternal and Triune God in His becoming
a man. God is complete, perfect, and unchanging, but He has had many
transformations. In my youth I was taught that the Lord Jesus is the same
yesterday, today, and forever (Heb. 13:8). But after I got into the intrinsic
depths of the Scriptures, I found out that merely to say this is not adequate
in the interpretation of the deep mysteries concerning Christ, because the
Bible shows that God has been transformed. God became a man. Is this not
a transformation? (CWWL, 1994-1997, vol. 1, “Crystallization-study of the
Epistle to the Romans,” p. 378)

Today’s Reading

The Triune God became a God-man, bringing divinity into humanity and
mingling divinity with humanity as a prototype for the mass reproduction of
many God-men. He became the embodiment of the Triune God (John 1:14),
bringing God to man and making God contactable, touchable, receivable,
experienceable, enterable, and enjoyable.
He could not have lived a human life unless He had been transformed into
a man. He lived a human life, yet He lived not by His human life but by His
divine life to express the divine attributes in His human virtues. Such a living
is the model of the human living of His mass reproduction of the many Godmen (1 Pet. 2:21).

His death was not merely the all-inclusive death. It…was the all-problemssolving death. To accomplish such a death, He became the flesh of sin (but
only in its likeness—Rom. 8:3). He had the likeness of the flesh of sin, but
within Him there is no sin (1 John 3:5). It was by this that He was made sin (2
Cor. 5:21) and condemned sin in the flesh (Rom. 8:3)…. We need to pay our
full attention to this. He was God. First, He became a man. Second, He became
the embodiment of God, which was the real tabernacle. Then He became the
Lamb [John 1:29].

In His becoming a man, He also became a serpent (only in its likeness
as the bronze serpent—Num. 21:4-9; John 3:14)…. By becoming a serpent,
He destroyed the devil, the ancient serpent (Rev. 12:9; 20:2), who has the
might of death (Heb. 2:14), and He judged the world, which is the system
(invented by the satanic systematization), the cosmos, of the devil, its
ruler (John 12:31). As the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45b), He ended the old
man. As the end of the old man, He crucified the old man (Rom. 6:6) and
terminated the old creation. The old man is the representative, the center,
of the old creation, so by destroying the old man He terminated the old
creation.

In His all-conquering resurrection He accomplished three main things.
First, He uplifted His humanity for Him to be begotten of God as God’s
firstborn Son (Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29). Second, He became…the many sons
of God as His many brothers (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:29). He was born to be the
firstborn Son, and He became the many sons of God…. In the new man, Christ
is all the members and in all the members [Col. 3:10b-11] . We became
Christ in His resurrection….Third, Christ, as the last Adam, became the lifegiving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, the all-inclusive compounded Spirit, as
the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God (1 Cor.
15:45b; Exo. 30:23-25). (CWWL, 1994-1997, vol. 1, “Crystallization-study of

Rom. 8:37-39 …In all these things we more than conquer through Him
who loved us….Neither death nor life…nor things present nor things to
come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be

“慈绳〔直译，人的绳〕爱索”这辞指明神用祂
神圣的爱爱我们，不是在神性的水平上，乃是在人性

复活和升天。借着基督在祂人性里的这一切步骤，神
在祂救恩里的爱才临到我们。（罗五 8，约壹四 9 ～
10。）在基督之外，神永远长存的爱，就是祂不变、
征服人的爱，在我们身上就无法得胜。神不变的爱是
得胜的，因为这爱是在基督里、同着基督、借着基
督、并为着基督的。（圣经恢复本，何十一 4 注 1。）

The phrase with cords of a man, with bands of love indicates that God
loves us with His divine love not on the level of divinity but on the level of
humanity. God’s love is divine, but it reaches us in the cords of a man, that is,
through Christ’s humanity. The cords through which God draws us include
Christ’s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. It
is by all these steps of Christ in His humanity that God’s love in His salvation
reaches us (Rom. 5:8; 1 John 4:9-10). Apart from Christ, God’s everlasting
love, His unchanging, subduing love, could not be prevailing in relation to us.
God’s unchanging love is prevailing because it is a love in Christ, with Christ,
by Christ, and for Christ. (Hosea 11:4, footnote 1)

this love to us has become the love of Christ (v. 35), which does many
marvelous things for us through the grace of Christ until God’s complete
salvation is accomplished in us. These marvelous things provoke God’s
enemy to attack us with all kinds of sufferings and calamities (vv. 35-36).
However, because of our response to the love of God in Christ, these attacks
have become benefits to us (v. 28). Hence, we more than conquer in all our
afflictions and calamities (v. 37).

By the end of chapter 8 Romans has covered the first half of God’s salvation
in Christ. This salvation has saved us to the extent that, on the one hand, we are
in God’s acceptance enjoying the source of this salvation, which is God’s love in
Christ, from which we cannot be separated by any person, matter, or thing; and,
on the other hand, we are in God’s life being conformed by the Lord Spirit to reach
the ultimate goal of this salvation, that is, to enter into the incomparable divine
glory and be glorified together with God (vv. 18, 30). (Rom. 8:39, footnote 1)

In His all-transcending ascension He became the Head of all things to be
the Head of the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23; Col. 1:18). He was made the
Head of all things that He might be the Head of the Body. He also became the
Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36), the Leader (of all the kings) and Savior (5:31),
our High Priest in God’s New Testament economy (Heb. 4:14; 7:26; 9:11), the
Mediator of the new covenant (v. 15), the surety of the better covenant (7:22),
the Paraclete (Advocate, Comforter) of the New Testament believers (1 John
2:1; John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7), the New Testament believers’ Intercessor
at the right hand of God and within them as well (Rom. 8:34, 26), and the
heavenly Minister (Heb. 8:2). In eternity past He was not all these items. He
became all these items in His all-transcending ascension.
The transformations of the eternal and Triune God in His becoming a man are
for the accomplishment of God’s eternal economy. Such a vision should control,
direct, and be our goal for our whole life until we see Him. (CWWL, 1994-1997,

2 Cor. 3:16-18 …Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken
away. And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is freedom. But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting
like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same
image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.

〔我们的〕心怎样向主开启呢？每当我们要定规
一件事，要有一个主张的时候，我们都该先转向主
说，“主啊，我爱你，我愿意讨你的喜悦。”这样，
我们的心志就向主打开了。这一打开，主就进到我们
的心志里。每一次我们有所爱好，有所愿望时，我们
都当在那里停一停，对主说，“主啊，我爱你，我要
讨你的喜悦。”这样，我们的心情向主就开启了，主
当然就进到我们的心情里了。同样的，每一次我们思
想一件事时，先把我们的思想停一停，对主说，“主
啊，我爱你，我要讨你的喜悦。”这就是我们在心思
里，向主开了一个口，主就能从这个口，进到我们
心思里。…我们如此一再地在心思…里，向主敞开，
主的灵就能一再地得着机会，进到我们魂的各部分。
（基督徒生命成熟的路，一五六至一五七页。）

How do we open our heart to the Lord? Whenever we have to make a
determination or decision, we should first say to the Lord, “O Lord, I love You.
I am willing to please You.” This kind of prayer opens our will to the Lord,
and once our will is opened, the Lord will enter into it. In addition, whenever
we love or desire something, we should stop for a moment and say to the
Lord, “O Lord, I love You. I want to please You.” This opens our emotion to the
Lord. When we do this, the Lord will surely enter into our emotion. Similarly,
whenever we begin to think about something, we should stop our thinking
for a moment and say to the Lord, “O Lord, I love You. I want to please You.”
This kind of statement opens our mind to the Lord, and through this opening,
the Lord will be able to enter into our mind. Whenever we open to the Lord
in our mind, the Lord’s Spirit will gain the opportunity to enter into the
different parts of our soul. (CWWL, 1955, vol. 3, “The Way for a Christian to
Mature in Life,” pp. 307-308)

Today’s Reading

Whenever our heart opens to the Lord, this Spirit spreads out from within
us into our mind, emotion, and will….One obvious proof [of this] is the
freedom mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:17….Once you have the Spirit of the
Lord in your mind, your mind will have freedom. Once you have the Spirit
of the Lord in your emotion, your emotion will also have freedom. And once
you have the Spirit of the Lord in your will, it will surely be freed.

若有人说聚会沉闷，我们就要领悟是他自己里面

二○二○年十二月半年度训练 - 第 6 周 晨兴圣言 - 第 8 页

If someone says that a meeting is boring, we must realize that it is he
himself who is bored within. Because his spirit, his inner being, is bored, he
feels that everything is boring…. If you do not let the Spirit of the Lord spread
out of you, you will be restrained and depressed….Your mind, emotion, and
will are not released and thus have no joy…. If you do not let the Spirit pass
through you, surely you will not have freedom.

Second Corinthians 3:18… includes the phrase reflecting like a mirror. If
we have our face covered with a veil, there will be a barrier between the light
and us. It is not until we have the veil taken away that our face and the light
can be face to face. Then we can see the light. This is like the reflecting of a
mirror. Because the Spirit is in us, we have freedom, our face is unveiled to
the Lord, and we are face to face with Him. His glory shines upon our face,
and we reflect His glory like a mirror. We cannot pretend to do this.

If day by day we love the Lord and give Him the opportunities, day by day the
Lord will spread out from within us. Then we will grow and be transformed day
by day. Ultimately, we will be transformed into the image of the Lord….This image
is the Lord Himself. People will realize that we have a certain condition. This
condition is the image of the Lord. We can also call this a condition of having glory,
freedom, release, the presence of the Lord, and the Lord’s Spirit. These five things
are actually one. The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
freedom. When we have freedom, our face is unveiled to see the glory of the Lord.
Then, from glory to glory, we are transformed into the image of the Lord.

When the Lord lives out from within us, we grow and become mature.
Therefore, we need to open our heart to the Lord and let Him spread out
from our spirit into our mind, emotion, and will….When our mind is like
His mind, our desires are like His desires, and our decisions are like His
decisions, we will have His image. (CWWL, 1955, vol. 3, “The Way for a
Christian to Mature in Life,” pp. 308-310, 313-315)

Morning Nourishment

林后四 10“身体上常带着耶稣的治死，使耶稣的
生命也显明在我们的身体上。”

2 Cor. 4:10 Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus
that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.

16“所以我们不丧胆，反而我们外面的人虽然在
毁坏，我们里面的人却日日在更新。”

16 Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying,
yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.

借着重生，借着第二次的出生，我们都成了新人。
如今我们〔凭天然的出生，〕外面是老旧的，但我们里
面乃是新的。然而神并不满意于把我们留在旧人里。祂
要我们的旧人借着变化而更新。变化使我们从一个形
状，就是从旧人的形状，迁移到另一个形状，就是新人
的形状。…主乃是借着基督之死的杀死来完成这事。

Through regeneration,…the second birth, we all became a new man.
Now outwardly we are old [by our natural birth], but inwardly we are new.
However, God is not satisfied to leave us in the old man. He wants our old
man to be renewed by transformation. Transformation transfers us from one
form, the form of the old man, to another form, the form of the new man….
The Lord accomplishes this by the killing of Christ’s death.

在〔林后四章十节〕这里，“治死”的意思是“杀
死”。基督的死杀死我们，祂的死就是我们里面那杀
死的性能。（基督徒的生活，一八九至一九○页。）

信息选读
我们不该忘记祂的死乃是包括在包罗万有、复合
的灵里…，由出埃及三十章二十三至二十五节里复
合的膏油所表征。这复合的灵有神作为基本的成分，
由一欣的橄榄油所表征。这油复合着四种香料—没
药、肉桂、菖蒲和桂皮。这四种香料表征基督之死
和复活的元素。不仅如此，四这个数字表征受造的
人。因此，膏油所表征的那灵乃是神与人的复合。
神人耶稣已经与祂死和复活的元素复合在一起。

Putting to death here [in 2 Corinthians 4:10] means “killing.” The death of
Christ kills us. His death is the killing capacity within us. (CWWL, 1991-1992,
vol. 2, “The Christian Life,” pp. 479-480)

Today’s Reading

We should not forget that His death is included in the all-inclusive, compound
Spirit…, typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. This
compound Spirit has God as the base, typified by one hin of olive oil. This oil is
compounded with four spices—myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. These
spices typify the elements of Christ’s death and resurrection. Furthermore, the
number four typifies the created man. Thus, the Spirit, typified by the ointment,
is a compound of God and man. The God-man, Jesus, has been compounded
together with the elements of His death and resurrection.

在今天的抗生素里，有一些元素是非常活跃的，可
Within today’s antibiotics there is some element that is very active to kill the
以杀死细菌。照样，在复合之灵这个大药剂里，有基 germs. In like manner, within this compound Spirit as a big dose, there is the
督之死的元素，活跃地杀死我们里面一切消极的事物。 element of Christ’s death, which is active in killing all the negative things within us.

我们与生俱来的所是，无论好坏，无论有没有用，

都必须被拆毁，好使圣灵在我们里面形成新的个性、

行，用神圣的生命光照、感动、引导、并浸透我们；

Everything related to us is under the Lord’s sovereign arrangement.
What kind of job we have and whom we marry are altogether not up to us. A
brother may choose a sister to be his wife, but later this brother may think
that he made a mistake. This is why the Lord charges the husbands to love
their wives (Eph. 5:25). Under the Lord’s sovereign arrangement, we are
like lambs brought to the slaughter every day…. Every day we are under the
killing of Christ’s death that His life may be manifested in our body in the
renewing of our inner man. (CWWL, 1991-1992, vol. 2, “The Christian Life,”
pp. 480-483)
Whatever we are by birth, whether good or bad, whether useful or not,
is natural and altogether a hindrance to the Holy Spirit in constituting the
divine life into our being. For this reason our natural strength, natural
wisdom, natural cleverness, natural disposition, natural shortcomings,
natural virtues, and natural attributes, plus our character and habits, must all
be torn down in order that the Holy Spirit may form in us a new disposition,
new character, new habits, new virtues, and new attributes. In order to
accomplish this work of reconstitution, the Holy Spirit of God moves within
us to enlighten, inspire, lead, and saturate us with the divine life. He also
works in our environment to arrange every detail, person, matter, and thing
in our situation to tear down what we are naturally. (Watchman Nee—a Seer
of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, p. 115)

林后四 1“因此，我们既照所蒙的怜悯，受了这
职事，就不丧胆。”

2 Cor. 4:1 Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy,
we do not lose heart.

罗五 3 ～ 74“不但如此，就是在患难中，我们也
是夸耀，因为知道患难生忍耐，忍耐生老练，
老练生盼望。”

Rom. 5:3-4 And not only so, but we also boast in our tribulations, knowing
that tribulation produces endurance; and endurance, approvedness;
and approvedness, hope.

职事出自启示加上苦难。人若没有启示，就…没
有什么可供应的。人也许有启示，但若缺少苦难，
他仍没有职事。…职事是〔比教训〕更高更深的。
恩赐是肤浅的，价值低；职事是有分量的，价值高。
你若从神领受了启示，祂就要将你摆在苦难中，为
要使你有职事。

Ministry is the issue of revelation plus suffering. Without revelation, one…
has nothing to minister. But though one may have revelation, if he lacks
suffering, he still has no ministry….Ministry is something higher and deeper
[than teaching]. Gift is superficial and costs little, while ministry is weighty
and costly. If you have received revelation from God, He will put you into
suffering in order that you may have ministry.

我们从使徒保罗的著作能看见，在他忍受苦难之
前，他领受了启示。他领受了启示，没有立刻出去，
将这启示当作教训或知识传给人。这样作不会是职
事，乃是一种教训或恩赐的运用。他领受启示之后，
主就将他摆在一些苦难中。因此，他所有的书信中
都有这次序：第一是启示，第二是苦难，第三是出
自前二者的职事。领受启示是一回事；将这启示作
到我们这人里面是另一回事。（倪柝声—今时代神
圣启示的先见，二一一至二一二页。）

信息选读

From the writings of the apostle Paul, we can see that before he endured
suffering, he received revelation. When he received the revelation, he did
not immediately go out to pass it on as teaching or knowledge. To do so
would not have been ministry; it would have been a sort of teaching or an
exercise of gift. But after receiving the revelation, the Lord put him into
some suffering. Hence, in all his Epistles we have this sequence: first, the
revelation; second, the sufferings; and third, the ministry which came out
of the first two. To receive revelation is one thing; to have that revelation
wrought into our being is something else. (Watchman Nee—a Seer of the
Divine Revelation in the Present Age, p. 193)

我与倪弟兄在一起多年。…他是一个属于十字架
的人。他从各方所接受的苦难就是十字架的工作，
他所领受关于十字架的启示也作到他里面。…我能
从我深处见证，他所作的就是职事；他所作的就是
他 所 是 的。（ 倪 柝 声 — 今 时 代 神 圣 启 示 的 先 见，
二一二至二一三页。）
我们天然的人需要圣别、变化并模成。所以，神
带进某些患难和苦难，叫我们得益处。…患难和苦
难是为着我们的变化。我们都宝贵平安、恩典和荣
耀，但没有人喜欢患难。
患难实际上是恩典连同基督一切丰富的化身。…
我们若说我们宝贵恩典却不宝贵患难，这就好象说
我们爱神却不爱耶稣。然而，拒绝耶稣就是拒绝神。
同样，拒绝患难就是拒绝恩典。…神成为肉体就是
祂恩典的眷临。…我们若爱祂的眷临，就必须爱祂
的成为肉体。恩典与患难是一样的；患难是眷临我
们之恩典的化身。虽然我们爱神的恩典，但我们也
必须亲吻患难，就是恩典的化身，恩典甜美的眷临。
患 难 的 经 历 产 生 忍 耐。（ 罗 五 3。） 这 里 的 忍
耐，意思是坚忍；坚忍是耐心加上受苦的产物。我
们没有人生来就有忍耐，忍耐是借着忍受患难所产
生的。…忍耐生老练。（4。）老练是一种蒙称许的
品质或属性，是忍受并经历患难和试验的结果。因
此，老练是能被称许的品质或属性。有时候，年轻
弟兄很难得着别人的称许。他们需要忍耐，这忍耐
产生容易被别人称许的品质。患难带进忍耐，忍耐
产生蒙称许的品质。（罗马书生命读经，一二二至

I was with Watchman Nee for years…. He was a person of the cross. The
sufferings he received from all directions were just the working of the cross,
and the revelation he received concerning the cross was wrought into him…. I
can testify from the depths of my being that what he did was a ministry; what
he did was what he was. (Watchman Nee—a Seer of the Divine Revelation in
the Present Age, pp. 194-195)
Our natural being needs to be sanctified, transformed, and conformed.
Therefore, God brings in certain tribulations and sufferings for our good….
Tribulation and suffering are for our transformation. We all appreciate peace,
grace, and glory, but no one likes tribulation.
Tribulation is actually the incarnation of grace with all the riches of
Christ…. If we say that we appreciate grace but not tribulation, it is like saying
that we love God but not Jesus. However, to reject Jesus is to reject God.
Likewise, to reject tribulation is to reject grace….The incarnation of God was
His gracious visitation…. If we love His visit, we must love His incarnation. It
is the same with grace and tribulation. Tribulation is the incarnation of grace
visiting us. Although we love God’s grace, we must also kiss the tribulation,
which is the incarnation of grace, the sweet visitation of grace.

The experience of tribulation produces endurance (Rom. 5:3). Endurance
is more than patience; it is the product of patience plus suffering. None of
us was born with endurance; it is produced by the suffering of tribulation.
Endurance produces approvedness (v. 4). Approvedness is an approved
quality resulting from the endurance of tribulation and testing. Thus,
approvedness is a quality or attribute that can be approved. At times, it
is difficult for young brothers to have the approval of others. They need
the endurance which produces a quality that is easily approved by others.
Tribulation issues in endurance, and endurance brings forth the quality of
approvedness. (Life-study of Romans, pp. 105-106)

into precious materials and to be built up as a counterpart to God—
Gen. 1:26-27; 2:9-12, 18-24.

B. As a fallen man, man needed to receive Christ for his redemption
(typified by the sacrifice with its shed blood) that he might be justified
by God in Christ (typified by the coats of the sacrifice’s skins); fallen
man also needed to receive Christ as the seed of the woman that he
might be delivered from Satan the “serpent’s” death-power—3:8-9,
15, 21; Heb. 2:14.

§Day 2

C. God regarded man and was pleased with man in the burnt offering; as
the reality of the burnt offering, Christ lived a life that was absolutely
for God and for God’s satisfaction as a satisfying fragrance to God for
His delight and pleasure—Gen. 4:4; 8:20-22; Lev. 1:9; Isa. 42:1; Matt.
3:17; 17:5; 12:18; John 5:30; 6:38; 7:18; 8:29; 14:24; cf. 2 Cor. 2:15; S. S.
4:10-16.
D. God promised Abraham that in his seed (Christ) all the nations of the
earth would be blessed—Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:8, 14, 16-17.

E. As a person chosen by God, man needed to receive and answer God’s
call (Gen. 12:1-4), to live before God through Christ as his burnt
offering (v. 7; 13:18; 22:13), to be exposed by the law that he might
know that he was sinful and did not have the capacity to keep the law
(Exo. 19:8, 21—20:21), and to live with God by taking Christ as the
tabernacle, the Priest, and the offerings so that he might enter into
God and enjoy all that God is with Christ and in Christ (Exo. 25—Lev.
27).
F. According to the way of Job’s nomadic living (Job 1:3) and the way he
offered the burnt offering for his children (v. 5), it seems that Job and
his friends probably lived in the age of Abraham (Gen. 22:13); at that
time the Pentateuch of Moses with the law was not yet written:

1 约伯和他的朋友们必然在口头上从他们的先祖接受
了一些神圣的启示；然而，他们从他们的先祖所接
受的，最多只达到在亚伯拉罕时代之启示的水平。
2 因此，在他们关于神与人之关系的辩论中，没有一
点迹象指明他们得着了超过有关神的审判，以及神
因着人的燔祭而看中人的神圣启示。
3 约伯和他的朋友们也没有说到任何话含示关于基督
和神的灵的事；他们乃是在神圣启示的原始阶段。
4 神向约伯显现时，似乎在说，“约伯，你事实上并
不认识我是谁。你没有看见我是无限的；此外，
你也无法想象我要给你什么。约伯，我要把我自己
给你，使我自己成为你的享受，好叫你成为我的一
部分。我不满意你有你自己的纯全、完全和正直。
我要你得着我。我的目的是要将我自己分授到你里
面，不是给你别的，乃是将我自己给你。”
5 因此，神所拣选并救赎的人，不需要在诸如完全、正
直、纯全等人性的美德上建立自己，就如约伯所作
的；乃需要象切慕溪水的鹿一样寻求神，并与神的子
民在神的节期里一同享受神，（诗四二 1 ～ 5，四三
3 ～ 5，）好叫神能成为他们的一切，以顶替他们所
达到并得着的；这该是给约伯三个朋友的答案，甚至
是给以利户和约伯的答案。（伯十 13，参弗三 9。）
6 在约伯记末了，神终于进来，指明约伯在他人生中所
缺少的乃是神自己；因这缘故，约伯记事实上并没有
一个完成的结束，这结束应当是：神在基督里完全给
约伯得着，使约伯与神成为一，好叫他能享受神在基

§Day 3

1. Surely, Job and his friends had received some revelation from their
forefathers verbally; however, what they had received of their forefathers
could reach, at most, only the level of the revelation in the age of Abraham.
2. Hence, in their debates concerning God’s relationship with man, there
is no hint that indicates that they had received divine revelation beyond
God’s judgment and God’s regard for man in his burnt offering.
3. Job and his friends did not speak any word that implies anything
concerning Christ and the Spirit of God; they were in the primitive stage
of the divine revelation.

4. In His appearing to Job, God seemed to be saying, “Job, you actually do not
know who I am; you do not realize that I am unlimited; also, you cannot
imagine what I intend to give you; Job, I intend to give you Myself, making
Myself your enjoyment so that you can become a part of Me; I am not
satisfied that you have your own integrity, perfection, and uprightness;
I want you to have Me; My intention is to impart Myself into you and to
give you nothing other than Myself.”

5. Thus, God’s chosen and redeemed people do not need to build up
themselves in human virtues, such as perfection, uprightness, and
integrity, as Job did, but they need to seek after God as a panting hart and
to enjoy God with God’s people in God’s feasts (Psa. 42:1-5; 43:3-5) so
that God can be everything to them to replace all that they have attained
and obtained; this should be the answer to Job’s three friends and even to
Elihu and Job (Job 10:13; cf. Eph. 3:9).
6. At the end of the book of Job, God came in, indicating that what Job was
short of in his human life was God Himself; for this reason, the book of
Job does not actually have a completed ending, which should be God fully
gained in Christ by Job to make him one with God so that he might enjoy
God as his portion in Christ; such a revelation can be fully found only in

A. As a person who has been chosen and called by God, man needs to
believe into Jesus Christ, who is the incarnated God, who lived a
human life, died, resurrected, and ascended for them and with them,
and who became the life-giving Spirit as the pneumatic Christ to them,
that He may be their salvation, life, and everything (which is revealed
in Matthew through Romans):

1. God came to be conceived in a human virgin and to be born of her to be a
man, thus bringing divinity into humanity and causing God and man to be
mingled as one entity but not as a third substance—Lev. 2:4-5; John 1:1,
14; Matt. 1:20, 23; 1 Tim. 3:16.
2. Jesus lived a life in which He did everything in God, with God, and for
God; God was in His living, and He was one with God; in His human living
He has set His suffering life before us as a model so that we can copy it by
tracing and following His steps; this does not refer to a mere imitation of
Him and His life but to a reproduction of Him that comes from enjoying
Him as grace in our sufferings, so that He Himself as the indwelling Spirit,
with all the riches of His life, reproduces Himself in us—Eph. 4:20-21; 1
Pet. 2:21.

Triune God (Col. 2:9), died in His humanity a vicarious and all-inclusive
death to terminate all the negative things and to release the divine life
from within Him for us (Luke 12:49-51; John 12:24).

4. He overcame death, entered into the all-producing resurrection, was
begotten to be God’s firstborn Son (bringing humanity into divinity), and
became the life-giving Spirit for the producing and constituting of the
Body of Christ—Acts 2:23-24, 32; 13:33; Rom. 1:3-4; 8:28-29; John 20:22;
1 Cor. 15:45; 12:13.
5. He accomplished the all-transcending ascension to the heavens and
was made Lord, Christ, Leader, and Savior (Acts 2:36; 5:31) for His
propagation and for the building up of the church as His kingdom (1:8;
26:16-18).
6. In His death, resurrection, and ascension He made all His believers one
with Him; thus, His death, resurrection, and ascension all became theirs,
and His experience became their history—Rom. 6:5-6; Eph. 2:5-6; Hymns,
#949, stanza 4.

B. As a believer in Christ, man needs to grow in the divine life of Christ
that he may be transformed into what Christ is through the lifedispensing Spirit, that he may be built up with the saints to be the
Body of Christ, the organism to express the Triune God in Christ, and
to be the new man as God’s new creation to carry out God’s eternal
economy in the consummation of the New Jerusalem as a mingling of
the processed Triune God with the glorified tripartite man, to be the
corporate God-man’s manifestation in eternity (which is revealed in 1
Corinthians through Revelation):

1. God redeemed us in Christ, forgave our sins, washed us, justified us,
and reconciled us to Him; God has put us into Christ and made Him our
righteousness, sanctification, and redemption—Eph. 1:7; 1 Cor. 6:11;

多事要告诉祂的门徒，但他们那时担当不了，只等
实际的灵来将这些事启示给他们；（约十六 12 ～

4. God the Father is embodied in God the Son (Col. 2:9), God the Son is

the Spirit as the Triune God have become the source, the element, and the
essence of the church as the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:4-6).
5. Concerning the mystery of the Triune God being the reality in the
believers, Christ had many things to tell His disciples, but they could
not bear them until the Spirit of reality came to reveal these things to
them (John 16:12-15); this was done by the Spirit of reality mainly with
the apostle Paul, who completed the word of God, that is, the divine
revelation (Col. 1:25-27) regarding Christ as the mystery of God (2:2b)
and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4).
6. Christ, as the divine portion allotted to the saints by God and as life in the
believers, has become all the members of the new man and is in all the
members of the new man, which is His organic Body; God wants to make
Christ, the embodiment of God, everything to us, the believers of Christ—
Col. 1:12, 15-19; 3:4a, 10-11; 1 Cor. 12:12-13.

of the Lord to see the Lord ourselves and reflect the glory of the Lord to
enable others to see Him through us—2 Cor. 3:16-18.

transformation consummates in the New Jerusalem, first with the
overcomers in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 2:7) and consummately with
all the saints in the new heaven and new earth, making all His chosen and

kind of merely human virtues (as Job did), to the fullest extent in eternity

乃是作新造。”

Gal. 6:15 For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a

在旧约里，神同着人，并在人中间行动，但祂
从未在人里面行动。…乃是到了新约时代，神才
来到地上在人里面行动。在新约时代，神行动的
第一步乃是进到人里面。神取了确定的步骤进到
人里，这为祂在整个新约时代在人里的行动立下
根基。神进到童女腹中，并留在其中九个月，为
要从那童女而生。

God moved with men and among men in the Old Testament, but He never
moved in man. It was not until the age of the New Testament that God came
to move on this earth in man. His first step to move in the New Testament age
was to enter into man. God took a definite step to enter into man, and this
laid a foundation for His move in man throughout the New Testament. God
entered into the womb of a human virgin and stayed there for nine months
to be born of that virgin.

当新约时代来临时，神的作法完全改变了。在旧
约里，祂一直是同着人，并在人中间作工，却是在
人的外面作工。…新约与旧约的不同，乃在于一个
事实，就是神进到了人里面。神从人而生。马太一
章二十节说，那生在马利亚里面的，乃是出于圣灵。
神生在马利亚里面。有一天，神带着祂的神性从永
远里出来，进到一个童女里面，生在她的腹中。（神

When the New Testament age came, God’s entire way changed. He was
in the Old Testament working all the time with men and among men but
outside of men….The New Testament is different from the Old Testament in
the one fact that God entered into man. God was born of man. Matthew 1:20
says that what was begotten in Mary was of the Holy Spirit. God was born in
Mary. One day God came out of eternity with His divinity and entered into a
human virgin’s womb to be born there. (CWWL, 1993, vol. 1, “The Move of
God in Man,” p. 398)

Today’s Reading

Beginning from His incarnation, God moved mainly in man. In the New
Testament whatever God did was mainly in man. The small preposition in
may be considered as the greatest word in the New Testament. If you take
this preposition away, the New Testament becomes empty. This is like taking
the switch away from an electrical appliance. Without the switch, it will
not work, because the electricity cannot flow into it. The phrase in Christ

们里面，就没有基督徒的生活，也没有召会生活。
在创世记、出埃及记、利未记、民数记、和申命
记里，神同着摩西行动。之后神又在约书亚记、士
师记、和撒母耳记里行动。然后，在某种程度上，
祂与所有的以色列王和申言者一同行动。但那不是
完成神为着基督与召会之永远经纶的直接行动。
神同着人，并在人中间行动，乃是在祂旧造里间
接的行动，为着在祂新造里祂永远经纶的直接行动
作准备。因此，在旧约里没有提到召会。召会是隐
藏的奥秘。旧约从来没有直接说到神永远的经纶。
神在新约里的经纶，绝对是独一的。在旧约里，你
看不见神为着祂永远经纶的直接行动。神间接作了
许多准备，好使祂有一日能来直接的作工。（神在
人里的行动，五至七页。）
神创造人，要人接受祂作生命，使人彰显祂，并变
化成为宝贵的材料，为着祂的建造，且得以被建造为
祂的配偶，与祂相配。（创一 26 ～ 27，二 9 ～ 12，
18 ～ 24。）神从亚当身上取了一条肋骨，建造成一个
女人，与亚当相配，作他的配偶。这是个预表，显示
神在基督里如何是丈夫，需要一个配偶与祂相配。因
此，在这预表的应验里，有东西从基督—神圣的生命—
出来了，而成为召会，就是基督的新妇，与祂相配。
人堕落之后，神应许堕落的人，基督要来作女人
的后裔，为人毁坏那“蛇”撒但，并用祭牲（预表基
督）所流的血和祭牲的皮子作衣服，救赎并称义人。

部分。（约伯记生命读经，一九九至二○○页。）

is repeated frequently in the New Testament. If we were not in Christ and
Christ were not in us, there would be no Christian life or church life.

God moved in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy
with Moses. Then God moved in the books of Joshua, Judges, and Samuel.
Then He moved to a certain extent with all the kings of Israel and the
prophets. But that was not God’s direct move to carry out His eternal
economy for Christ and the church.

God’s move with men and among men was just the indirect move in His
old creation for the preparation of His direct move in His new creation for
His eternal economy. This is why the church is not mentioned in the Old
Testament. The church was a hidden mystery. God’s eternal economy was
never directly touched in the Old Testament. God’s economy in the New
Testament is absolutely unique. In the Old Testament you cannot see God’s
move for His eternal economy directly. God did a lot indirectly to prepare for
the day when He could come to do the direct work. (CWWL, 1993, vol. 1, “The
Move of God in Man,” p. 400)
God created man and wanted man to take Him as life that man might
express Him, be transformed into precious materials for His building, and be
built up to be His counterpart to match Him (Gen. 1:26-27; 2:9-12, 18-24).
God took a rib out of Adam and built it up into a woman to match Adam to
be his counterpart. This is a type showing how God in Christ is the Husband,
needing a match, a counterpart. Therefore, in the fulfillment of this type,
something came out of Christ—the divine life—to become the church, which
is the bride to match Christ.
After man became fallen, God promised the fallen man that Christ would
come as the seed of woman to destroy the “serpent,” Satan, for man and to
redeem and justify man with the shed blood and the coats of the skins of
the sacrifice, typifying Christ (3:8-9, 15, 21). These things are a part of God’s
relationship with us. (Life-study of Job, pp. 169-170)

创四 4“亚伯也从他羊群中头生的，从羊的脂油 Gen. 4:4 And Abel also brought an offering, from the firstlings of his flock,
拿供物献上。耶和华看中了亚伯和他的供物。”
that is, from their fat portions. And Jehovah had regard for Abel and

for his offering.

二二 18“并且地上万国，都必因你的后裔得福；
因为你听从了我的话。”

22:18 And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed,
because you have obeyed My voice.

圣经中关于神与人的关系包括法前时代，其中一
部分是从神创造人到呼召亚伯拉罕。…创世记四章
四节和八章二十至二十二节说到预表基督的燔祭。
神看中人（就是尊重人），悦纳人，不是因着人的
善行，而是因着燔祭。这就是亚伯前来向神献燔祭，
神看中他和他供物的原因。

God’s relationship with man in the Scriptures includes the dispensation, the
section of time, before the law, part of which is the time from God’s creation of man
to the calling of Abraham. Genesis 4:4 and 8:20-22 speak of the burnt offering, a
type of Christ. God regarded man, that is, respected man, and was pleased with
man, not in man’s good doing, but in the burnt offering. This is why Abel came to
offer the burnt offering to God, and God regarded both him and his offering.

第二个时代是从呼召亚伯拉罕到借着摩西颁布律法的
这个时期。这个时代最重要的事，乃是神给亚伯拉罕的
应许。因这缘故，圣经教师称这时代为应许时代。…神
在这时代也是因着燔祭而看中人，（十二 7，十三 18，
二二 13，三一 54，伯一 5，）这是前一个时代的继续。…
此外，神也应许亚伯拉罕，地上万国（包括我们）必因
他的后裔（要来的基督）得福。（创二二 18，加三 8，
16。）至终，这应许完全应验了，如加拉太三章所启示
的。（约伯记生命读经，一九九至二○一页。）

The second dispensation covers the period of time from the calling of
Abraham to the decree of the law through Moses. As a continuation of the
previous dispensation, God again regarded man in the burnt offering (12:7;
13:18; 22:13; 31:54; Job 1:5). In addition, God promised Abraham that
in his seed, the coming Christ, all the nations of the earth, including us,
would be blessed (Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:8, 16). Eventually this promise was
absolutely fulfilled, as revealed in Galatians 3. (Life-study of Job, pp. 169171)

Today’s Reading

As the man created by God in His image (Gen. 1:26), man needed to
take God (symbolized by the tree of life) as his life that he might live God,
express God, and represent God (2:9); and as such a one, he needed to be
transformed into precious materials (vv. 10-12) and to be built up as a
counterpart to God (vv. 18-24).

二○二○年十二月半年度训练 - 第 7 周 晨兴圣言 - 第 4 页

As a fallen man, man needed to receive Christ for his redemption
(typified by the sacrifice with its shed blood) that he might be justified by
God in Christ (typified by the coats of the sacrifice’s skins—3:21). Fallen
man also needed to receive Christ as the seed of the woman that he might
be delivered from Satan the “serpent’s” death-power (v. 15; Heb. 2:14). All
these matters—the sacrifice with its blood, the coats of skins, and the seed
of the woman—are found in Genesis 3. I would encourage you all, even the
young ones, to learn these things and then try to present them to others. For
example, a young person may visit a younger relative and speak about the
need of fallen man to be justified by God in Christ or about the need for Christ
as the seed of woman. First, we should digest all these truths ourselves, and
then we should learn how to present them to others.
As a redeemed person, man needed to offer Christ as the burnt offering
that he might be regarded, respected, by God (Gen. 4:4). Man also needs to
call on the name of Jehovah (v. 26), to walk with God (5:22), to work for God
that he might be delivered from the corrupted and God-condemned world
(6:11-18), and to live before God through Christ as the burnt offering that the
earth could be kept in order (8:20-22).
As people chosen by God, we, the descendants of Abraham, the race
chosen by God, need to receive and answer God’s call (Gen. 12:1-4), to live
before God through Christ as our burnt offering (v. 7; 13:18; 22:13), to be
exposed by the law that we might know that we are sinful and do not have
the capacity to keep the law (Exo. 19:8, 21—20:21), and to live with God
by taking Christ as the tabernacle, the priest, and the offerings that we may
enter into God and enjoy all that God is with Christ and in Christ (Exo. 25—
Lev. 27).

According to the way of Job’s nomadic living (Job 1:3) and the way he
offered the burnt offering for his children, this book should have been
written at the time of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (v. 5; Gen. 22:13; 31:54),
about 2000 B.C. This means that Job was written five hundred years before
Moses wrote the Pentateuch. (Life-study of Job, pp. 187-189, 2)

Job 1:5 And when the days of feasting ran their course, Job…would rise

十 13“然而你待我的这些事，早已藏在你心里；

约伯和他的朋友们可能是活在亚伯拉罕的时代。
那时摩西五经尚未写成；他们必然在口头上从他们
的先祖接受了一些神圣的启示。然而，他们从他们
的先祖所接受的，最多只能达到在亚伯拉罕时代之
启示的水平。因此，在他们关于神与人之关系的辩
论中，没有一点迹象指明他们得着了超过有关神的
审判，以及神因着人的燔祭而看中人的神圣启示。
他们也没有说到任何话含示关于基督和神的灵的
事。他们乃是在神圣启示的原始阶段。（约伯记生
命读经，二○四页。）

Job and his friends probably lived in the age of Abraham. At that time
the Pentateuch of Moses was not yet written. Surely they had received
some divine revelation from their forefathers verbally. However, what they
had received of their forefathers could reach, at most, only the level of
the revelation in the age of Abraham. Hence, in their debates concerning
God’s relationship with man, there was no hint that indicates that they had
received divine revelation beyond the matters of God’s judgment and God’s
regard for man in his burnt offering. And they did not speak any word that
implies anything concerning Christ and the Spirit of God. They were in the
primitive stage of the divine revelation. (Life-study of Job, pp. 172-173)

After all the speaking of Job, his three friends, and Elihu, we have God’s
appearing to Job with the divine unveilings (Job 38:4—41:34). This is
followed by a word concerning Job’s gaining God in his personal experience
and his abhorring of himself (42:1-6). I am concerned that, by paying
attention to so many other things, you may not see the central point of God’s
appearing to Job. This central point concerns what God intended to do to Job
by His appearing to him.

God appeared to Job in order to help him to realize that God is unlimited,
unsearchable, and untraceable. God asked Job many questions about the

宙和动物的问题，为要叫他得着深刻的印象，就是
神是无限的。神似乎在对他说，“约伯，你事实上并
不认识我是谁。你没有看见我是无限的；此外，你也
无法想象我要给你什么。约伯，我要把我自己给你，
使我自己成为你的享受，好叫你成为我的一部分。我
不满意你有你自己的纯全、完全和正直。我要你得着
我。我的目的不是给你别的，乃是将我自己给你。”
我们要明白神向约伯显现的目的，就需要整本
圣经，特别是新约。神要把祂自己给约伯，不是
一件简单的事；这包含一个漫长的过程，开始于基
督的成为肉体，并且包括祂的人性生活、在十字架
上包罗万有的死、祂的复活和祂的升天。因为约伯
是在神圣启示的原始阶段，神无法对他说到这一切
的事；神若说这些事，约伯也不可能明白。这一切
事要到二千年后，在新约里才得着清楚的解释和记
录。甚至今天，许多信徒对这些事仍然没有正确的
领悟。
约伯和他的朋友们都没有以上的神圣启示。神用
各样灾难对付约伯，并剥夺他一切的所是，乃是要
除去他在敬虔成就和获得上的自满，并除去一切障
碍和遮蔽，使他被倒空，好进一步寻求神，并能领
悟他人生中非常缺少一些东西。在约伯记末了，神
终于进来，指明约伯在他人生中所缺少的乃是神自
己。但直到约伯的时代，还没有象在新约那样积极、
清楚、并完全揭示的启示。因这缘故，约伯记事实
上并没有一个完成的结束，这结束应当是：神在基
督里完全给约伯得着，使约伯与神成为一，好叫他
能享受神在基督里作他的分。这样的启示，只有在
新约里才能完满地看到。（约伯记生命读经，二○

universe and about the animals to impress him with the fact that He is
unlimited. God seemed to be saying to him, “Job, you actually do not know
who I am. You do not realize that I am unlimited. Also, you cannot imagine
what I intend to give you. Job, I intend to give you Myself, making Myself your
enjoyment so that you can become a part of Me. I am not satisfied that you
have your own integrity, perfection, and uprightness. I want you to have Me.
My intention is to give you nothing other than Myself.”

To understand God’s intention in His appearing to Job, we need the entire
Bible, especially the New Testament. For God to give Himself to Job was
not a simple matter. This involved a long process beginning with Christ’s
incarnation and including His human living, His all-inclusive death on the
cross, His resurrection, and His ascension. Because Job was in the primitive
stage of the divine revelation, God could not have spoken to him about all
these things. It would have been impossible for Job to understand them. All
these matters were clearly defined and recorded in the New Testament two
thousand years later. Even today, many believers do not have the proper
understanding of these things.
Job and his friends were devoid of all the above divine revelations. God’s
dealing with Job in all the disasters and His stripping him of all that he was,
were to take away his contentment in his godly attainments and obtainments
and to remove all the barriers and coverings so that he could be emptied for
some further seeking after God and could realize that he was very short of
something in his human life. At the end of the book of Job, after all, God came
in, indicating that what Job was short of in his human life was God Himself.
But up to the age of Job, there was not a revelation like what is positively,
clearly, and fully unveiled in the New Testament. For this reason, the book
of Job does not actually have a completed ending, which should be God fully
gained in Christ by Job to make him one with God that he might enjoy God
as his portion in Christ. Such a revelation can be fully found only in the New
Testament. (Life-study of Job, pp. 175-176, 185)

旧约的帐幕预表基督的成为肉体。（约一 14。）
真正的帐幕乃是神自己具体化身在基督里。这帐幕

The tabernacle in the Old Testament is a type of Christ’s incarnation (John

is a dwelling place not only for God but also for God’s chosen people. This
means that, after the incarnation, God is enterable. To be in Christ means
to enter into God to enjoy God…. Now through the redeeming blood we can
have fellowship with God.

Such a man who is in the incarnated God as his tabernacle did not need
to build up himself in human virtues, such as perfection, uprightness, and
integrity, as Job did, but he needed to seek after God as a panting hart and to
enjoy God with God’s people in God’s feasts (Psa. 42:1-5; 43:3-5) so that God
could be everything to him to replace all that he had attained and obtained.
This should be the answer to Job’s three friends and even to Elihu and Job.
Once again we see that if we would understand the book of Job, we need the
entire Bible.
The ones who have been chosen and called by God need to believe into
Jesus Christ, who is the incarnated God, who died, resurrected, and ascended
for us and with us, and who became the life-giving Spirit as the pneumatic
Christ to us, that He may be our salvation, life, and everything. This is
revealed in the New Testament, in the books from Matthew through Romans.

earth. He was incarnated in man, and He lived in man. In incarnation He
entered into the womb of Mary and remained there for nine months. After
His birth He passed through a human living of thirty-three and a half years.
Then He went to the cross to be crucified in man. Jesus was crucified on the
cross as a man, but He was not just a man. He was God Himself. Then He was
resurrected. He rose up from the dead in man and ascended to the heavens
in man. These are the five steps of His move. The five issues of these steps are
the church, the Body of Christ, the new man, the organism of the processed
and consummated Triune God, and the New Jerusalem. These five steps and
five issues cover the entire New Testament concerning the move of God in
man. The first page of the New Testament is on incarnation, and the last page
of the New Testament is on the New Jerusalem.
The move of God in man is unprecedented in history. Before the time of
God’s incarnation in Matthew 1, there was not such a thing in history as
God’s move in man. (CWWL, 1993, vol. 1, “The Move of God in Man,” p. 399)

The New Testament reveals that God came to be conceived in a human
virgin to be born of her to be a man, thus bringing divinity into humanity and
causing God and man to be mingled as one entity but not as a third substance
(John 1:1, 14; Matt. 1:20, 23; 1 Tim. 3:16). This is the first step God took in
order to give Himself to Job by the way of dispensing. (Life-study of Job, p.
181)

God’s move in His incarnation was to mingle divinity with humanity into
one entity, keeping the two elements distinguishable in the one entity without
producing a third element. A heretical teaching in the past said that when
divinity and humanity were mingled together, a third element was produced. In
the Old Testament there is the marvelous type of the meal offering to show us the
mingling of divinity with humanity in the person of Jesus Christ. Leviticus 2:45 says that the meal offering was of “fine flour mingled with oil.” The oil is a sign
of the Holy Spirit, and the fine flour is a sign of humanity. The Holy Spirit mingles
Himself with man to produce a meal offering that is good for food both to God
and to His priests. (CWWL, 1993, vol. 1, “The Move of God in Man,” pp. 402-403)

Jesus Christ, as the incarnated God and as the embodiment of the Triune
God (Col. 2:9), died in His humanity a vicarious and all-inclusive death to
terminate all the negative things and to release the divine life from within
Him for us. Christ overcame death and entered into the all-producing
resurrection and was begotten to be God’s firstborn Son, bringing humanity
into divinity (Acts 13:33). In resurrection Christ also became the life-giving
Spirit for the producing and the constituting of the Body of Christ (1 Cor.
15:45). Next, Christ accomplished the all-transcending ascension to the
heavens and was made Lord, Christ, Leader, and Savior (Acts 2:36; 5:31) for
His propagation and for the building up of the church as His kingdom. In His
death, resurrection, and ascension Christ made all His believers one with
Him…. His experiences have become their history.

公义（为着我们的已往），我们已经得神称义，使
我们能在灵里重生，得着神的生命。借着基督作我
们的圣别（为着我们的现在），我们在魂里渐渐被
圣别，也就是在我们的心思、情感和意志里，因神
圣的生命渐渐被变化。借着基督作我们的救赎（为
着 我 们 的 将 来 ）， 就 是 我 们 的 身 体 得 赎，（ 罗 八
23，）我们的身体要因祂神圣的生命改变形状，有
祂荣耀的样式。（腓三 21。）
神借着基督的复活，重生了我们，（彼前一 3，）
并且现今正在更新我们，变化我们，并将我们模成祂
荣耀的形像，至终要在祂的荣耀里荣化我们。（多三
5，…罗八 29 ～ 30。）…在祂的更新和变化里，神销
毁我们，将我们放在基督的死里，使我们有分于祂受
苦的交通，这受苦为我们成就永远重大的荣耀，使我
们在祂的复活里经历祂，并在祂那追测不尽的丰富里
得着祂。（林后四 16 ～ 17，10，腓三 10，8，弗三 8。）
作为在基督里的信徒，我们需要在基督神圣的生
命里长大，使我们可以借着分赐生命的灵，变化成
为基督的所是，好与众圣徒同被建造，成为基督的
身体，就是三一神在基督里的生机体，并成为新人，
作神的新造，以完成神永远的经纶，终极完成新耶
路撒冷，就是经过过程之三一神与得荣之三部分人
的调和，成为团体的神人在永世里的显出。
这样一位在基督里得重生、变化并荣化的圣徒，与
天然的人无分无关，也不需要用天然人的美德建立自
己。约伯和他的朋友们若活在认识这事的时代，他们
就会蒙拯救，免去他们在约伯记三十五章经文（三～
三七）里浪费时间、加添痛苦、并虚空的辩论；这些
经文乃是一群瞎眼的人在黑暗中摸索的记载。（约伯
记生命读经，二一二至二一四、二二二至二二三页。）

sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30). By Christ as our righteousness
(for our past) we have been justified by God that we might be reborn in
our spirit to receive the divine life. By Christ as our sanctification (for our
present) we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our
mind, emotion, and will, with the divine life. By Christ as our redemption
(for our future), that is, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23), we will be
transfigured in our body with the divine life to have His glorious likeness (Phil.
3:21).

God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3), and
now He renews us, transforms us, and conforms us to His image of glory, and
ultimately He will glorify us in His glory (Titus 3:5;…Rom. 8:29-30). In His
renewing and transforming, God consumes us, putting us into Christ’s death
for our fellowship of His sufferings, which work out for us an eternal weight
of glory, that we may experience Him in His resurrection and gain Him in His
unsearchable riches (2 Cor. 4:16-17, 10; Phil. 3:10, 8; Eph. 3:8).

As believers in Christ, we need to grow in the divine life of Christ that we
may be transformed into what Christ is through the life-dispensing Spirit,
that we may be built up with the saints to be the Body of Christ, the organism
of the Triune God in Christ, and to be the new man as God’s new creation to
carry out God’s eternal economy in the consummation of the New Jerusalem
as the mingling of the processed Triune God with the glorified tripartite man,
to be the corporate God-man’s manifestation in eternity.
Such a regenerated, transformed, and glorified saint in Christ has nothing
to do with the natural man and does not need to build up himself with the
natural human virtues. If Job and his friends had lived at the time to know
this, they would have been saved from their time-wasting, pain-increasing,
and vain debates in thirty-five chapters as a record of a group of blind
persons groping in darkness. (Life-study of Job, pp. 182-183, 190)

关于三一神在信徒里面是实际的奥秘，基督还有
许多事要告诉祂的门徒，但他们那时担当不了，只

Son and realized as the Spirit.

Concerning the mystery of the Triune God being the reality in the
believers, Christ had many things to tell His disciples, but they could not
bear them until the Spirit of reality came to reveal these things to them (John
16:12-15). This was done by the Spirit of reality mainly with the apostle
Paul, who completed the word of God, that is, the divine revelation (Col. 1:2527) regarding Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2b) and the church as the
mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4).

基督作为神所分给众圣徒神圣的分，并作为信
徒的生命，成了新人（就是祂生机身体）的一切肢
体。（西一 12，三 4 上，10 ～ 11，林前十二 12 ～
13。）…神要使基督，就是神的具体化身，作我们
这些基督信徒的一切。〔西一 15 ～ 19。〕

Christ as the divine portion allotted to the saints by God and as life to
the believers has become all the members of the new man, which is His
organic Body (Col. 1:12; 3:4a, 10-11; 1 Cor. 12:12-13). God wants to make
Christ, the embodiment of God, everything to us, the believers of Christ [Col.
1:15-19].

God in Christ will carry out His transforming work on us until His
transformation consummates in the New Jerusalem, firstly with the
overcomers in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 2:7) and consummately with
all the saints in the new heaven and new earth, making all His chosen and
redeemed people His corporate expression, manifesting Himself, not any
kind of merely human virtues, to the fullest extent in eternity (Rev. 21:1—
22:5). (Life-study of Job, pp. 184-185)

According to the New Testament record, God’s move on earth in man is
always in the principle of incarnation. Our salvation is the move of God in
man and is the move of God to be a part of man. If God had never become us
in the sense of coming into us to be our very life, we could never have been
saved…. What is salvation, or regeneration? It is God coming into a man in
His divinity to make Himself a part of that man and to make that man a part
of Him. Salvation brings God into man and brings man into God. Salvation
makes God man so that man may be made God (but not the Godhead). This is
incarnation, and this principle of incarnation should be applied to our entire
Christian life.

In the Christian life the husbands and the wives should love each other,
but in their natural life they are not capable of doing this. What husband can
love his wife, and what wife can love her husband? If a Christian husband
really loves his wife, that is not him. This means that he is living in the
principle of Galatians 2:20—”I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer
I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.” For a husband to love his wife in
this way is in the principle of incarnation. Unless God is made you and you
are made God, you can never really love your wife…. Every Christian virtue
we have is a part of the incarnation. Every day as we live the Christian life,
the Triune God is being incarnated by being made us and by making us Him.
God is being made man, and man is being made God. When a brother really
loves his wife, at that time he is God in God’s life and nature but not in His
Godhead. In other words, God has been made him, and he has been made
God. This is the move of God in man in the principle of incarnation. (CWWL,
1993, vol. 1, “The Move of God in Man,” pp. 405-406)

二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 8 周纲要 - 第 1 页

A. The subject of Proverbs is living a godly life by God’s wisdom—3:13-18;
8:11.

B. The central thought of Proverbs is that we should seek after wisdom so
that we may live a godly life on earth that is acceptable to God—2:1-9.
C. Wisdom comes from God: “Jehovah gives wisdom; / From His mouth
come knowledge and understanding”—v. 6.
D. Wisdom is more valuable and better than gold, silver, and corals, and
is more desirable than anything else—3:14-15; 8:11, 19.

3:19; 4:5-9; 8:1-36:
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 8 - Page 1

1 神的智慧这样人位化，是指神圣三一的第二者，祂
成了从神给所有新约信徒的智慧—太十一 19，西二
3，林前一 24，30。
2 “耶和华以智慧立大地”—箴三 19 上：
a 耶和华借以立大地并定诸天的这一位，乃是基督，

c 神借着这位是智慧且为神所喜爱的基督创造万有—
三 19，西一 16 ～ 17，来一 2。

【周二】

1. This personification of God’s wisdom is a reference to the second of the
Divine Trinity, who became wisdom from God to all the New Testament
believers—Matt. 11:19; Col. 2:3; 1 Cor. 1:24, 30.
2. “Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth”—Prov. 3:19a:

a. This One by whom Jehovah founded the earth and established the heavens is
Christ, who is the wisdom of God—1 Cor. 1:24.

b. Wisdom, as the master workman of God’s creation of all things, is God’s
delight—Prov. 8:30.
c. God’s creation of all things is through Christ, who is wisdom and God’s
delight—3:19; Col. 1:16-17; Heb. 1:2.

§Day 2

贰 罗马十一章三十三节上半说到神的智慧： II. Romans 11:33a speaks of God’s wisdom: “Oh, the depth of
the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God!”:
“深哉，神的丰富、智慧和知识！”：
一 看见智慧与知识的不同是很重要的—33 节：
1 智慧是为着计划、定意—弗一 9，三 11。
2 智慧见于事物的创始，如罗马十一章三十六节所指
明的：“万有都是本于祂、借着祂、并归于祂。”
3 神是独一的创始者：“只有一位神，就是父，万物
都本于祂”—林前八 6 上：
a 神创始了许多东西，不是凭祂的知识，乃是凭祂的
智慧—箴三 19，八 12，22 ～ 31。
b 当神进来应用祂所创始的，祂就展示祂的知识。

二 神的智慧乃是“从前所隐藏，神奥秘中的智慧，
就是神在万世以前，为使我们得荣耀所预定
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 8 周纲要 - 第 2 页

A. It is important to see the difference between wisdom and knowledge—
v. 33:
1. Wisdom is for planning and purposing—Eph. 1:9; 3:11.

2. Wisdom is seen in the initiation of something, as indicated by Romans
11:36: “Out from Him and through Him and to Him are all things.”

3. God is the unique Initiator: “One God, the Father, out from whom are all
things”—1 Cor. 8:6a:

a. God has initiated many things, not by His knowledge but by His wisdom—
Prov. 3:19; 8:12, 22-31.
b. When God comes in to apply what He has initiated, He displays His
knowledge.

B. The wisdom of God is “God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which
has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 8 - Page 2

的”—林前二 7：
1 基督作为神的中心和我们的分，给我们享受，乃是
神奥秘中深奥的智慧—罗十一 33。
2 在神里面有奥秘中的智慧；这智慧是在万世以前所
隐藏，并为使我们得荣耀所预定的—林前二 7。

三 “愿荣耀借着耶稣基督，归与这位独一、智慧
的神，直到永永远远。阿们”—罗十六 27：

eventually glorify us and conform us to the image of God’s firstborn Son,

1. The wisdom of Christ’s deity was revealed in proportion to the measure
of His bodily growth—Col. 2:2-3; Luke 2:40, 52.
2. Matthew 11:19b indicates that wisdom is Christ:

a. Whatever Christ did was done by the wisdom of God, which is Christ
Himself—1 Cor. 1:24.

a. Those who believe in Christ are the children of wisdom, those who justify
Christ and His deeds and who follow Him as their wisdom.
b. Christ’s work is to produce us as the children of wisdom caring for the life of
wisdom.

B. In Christ “all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden”—

His spoken words, especially those recorded in the Gospels of Matthew
and John:
a. The Lord’s words recorded in these two books contain the highest philosophy.
b. The concept in the Lord’s words is deep and profound.

3. Since wisdom and knowledge are stored up in Christ as a treasure, we
cannot have wisdom and knowledge unless we have Christ—Col. 1:27; 3:4,

2. By Christ as our sanctification, we are being sanctified in our soul, that is,
transformed in our mind, emotion, and will with His divine life—6:19, 22;
12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18.

3. Christ as our redemption is for the redemption of our body, by which we
will be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious
likeness—Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21.

C. To us from God in 1 Corinthians 1:30 refers to something present,
practical, and experiential in the way of transmission:

1. For Christ to become wisdom to us from God indicates that there
is a transmission of Christ as wisdom from God to us for our daily
experience—v. 30.
2. Christ as wisdom should unceasingly flow from God to us to be our
present and practical wisdom in our experience.

3. If we remain with the Lord to receive His dispensing (John 15:4-5), He
will be transmitted into us as the wisdom to handle various problems and
matters.

4. If we are one with the Lord and receive His dispensing, we will
experience and enjoy Him as our wisdom day by day and hour by hour—

8:30 …I was by Him, as a master workman; and I was daily His delight,
rejoicing always before Him.
Wisdom is the Spirit of God (cf. Exo. 28:3; Deut. 34:9), which is also Christ;
thus, it can be poured out upon man (Prov. 1:23). This is very clear in the
New Testament: those who receive wisdom are those who are filled with the
Holy Spirit (Acts 6:3, 10). First Corinthians 12:8 says that a word of wisdom
is given to man through the Spirit; thus, we cannot receive the words in
Proverbs by our natural concepts. Rather, we need to let the Spirit of God be
poured upon us so that we may receive wisdom. (CWWL, 1956, vol. 1, p. 506)

Today’s Reading

Blessed is the man who finds wisdom…. She is more precious than corals,
and nothing we desire compares with her. Length of days is in her right hand;
in her left hand are riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and
all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her, and
happy are those who hold her fast (Prov. 3:13-18; 8:11).
We should not let wisdom depart from our sight, but we should keep
sound wisdom and discretion. They will be life for our soul and a graceful
ornament for our neck (3:21-22). The real beauty is wisdom and discretion.

In certain portions of Proverbs the wisdom of God is personified. This
personification of God’s wisdom is the second of the Trinity, the Son of God.
Christ is the personified wisdom of God.

再次表征基督。我们若有基督作智慧，就有一切，
包括属灵的事物和物质的事物。（箴言生命读经，
一三至一六页。）

Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; He established the heavens by
understanding (3:19). This One by whom Jehovah founded the earth and
established the heavens is Christ, who is the wisdom of God.

In 8:22-31 personified wisdom says that Jehovah possessed her in the
beginning of His way, before His works of old. Wisdom was set up from
eternity, from the beginning, before the earth was. When there were no
depths, wisdom was brought forth, when there were no fountains abounding
with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, wisdom was
brought forth; when He had not yet made the earth and the fields, nor the first
dust of the world. When He established the heavens, wisdom was there; when
He inscribed a circle upon the surface of the deep, when He made firm the
skies above, when the fountains of the deep became strong, when He set for
the sea its boundary, that the waters should not transgress His commandment,
when He marked out the foundations of the earth; then wisdom was by Him,
as a master workman. Wisdom was daily His delight, rejoicing always before
Him, rejoicing in His habitable earth; and wisdom’s delight was in the sons of
men. Again, this personified wisdom refers to Christ.

In verses 12 through 21 we are told that wisdom dwells with prudence
and finds knowledge and discretion. Counsel and sound wisdom are hers.
Wisdom is understanding and has might. By wisdom kings reign, and
rulers decree justice. By wisdom princes rule, and nobles—all who judge
righteously. Wisdom loves those who love her, and those who seek wisdom
diligently will find her. Riches and honor are with wisdom, enduring wealth
and righteousness. Wisdom’s fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; and
her yield than choice silver. Wisdom walks in the way of righteousness, in
the midst of the paths of justice, that wisdom may cause those who love her
to inherit substance and that she may fill their treasuries. Once again, this
personified wisdom signifies Christ. If we have Christ as wisdom, we have
everything, including spiritual things and material things. (Life-study of
Proverbs, pp. 9-11)

以弗所一章说到神的能力，（19 ～ 20，）二章说
到神的恩典，（5 ～ 8，）三章说到神的智慧。神非
常有智慧，而宇宙显出祂的智慧。

Ephesians 1 speaks of the power of God (vv. 19-20), chapter 2, of the grace
of God (vv. 5-8), and chapter 3, of the wisdom of God. God is very wise, and
the universe reveals His wisdom.

我们需要看见智慧与知识的不同。歌罗西二章
三节把这二者并提。智慧比知识更高更深。智慧
见于事物的创始，比如一种新发明的设计；而知
识见于实际的应用。你若只有知识而缺少智慧，
你就无法创始什么，也不会发明什么。神是独一
的创始者。祂创始了许多东西，不是凭祂的知识，
乃是凭祂的智慧。当神进来应用祂所创始的，祂
就展示祂的知识。
对我们来说，智慧是在我们的灵里，知识是在我们
的心思里。你若不知道如何进入你的灵，即使你有许
多知识，你也不会有智慧。但你若是一个在灵里的人，
你就会有智慧。不仅如此，在你的心思里还有知识，
就是明达。（以弗所书生命读经，三二三至三二四页。）

We need to see the difference between wisdom and knowledge. In
Colossians 2:3 the two are mentioned together. Wisdom is both higher and
deeper than knowledge. Wisdom is seen in the initiation of something, for
example, in the formulation of a new invention, and knowledge is seen in the
practical application. If you have only knowledge and lack wisdom, you will not
be able to initiate anything nor to invent anything. God is the unique Initiator.
He has initiated many things, not by His knowledge, but by His wisdom. When
He comes in to apply what He has initiated, He displays His knowledge.

In our case, wisdom is in our spirit, and knowledge is in our mind. If
you do not know how to get into your spirit, you may have a great deal of
knowledge, but you will not have any wisdom. But if you are a person in the
spirit, you will be wise. Furthermore, in your mind you will have knowledge,
prudence. (Life-study of Ephesians, pp. 267-268)

Today’s Reading

Wisdom is different from cleverness and deeper than cleverness. It is
possible to be clever without being wise. For example, a criminal may be very
clever, but he is altogether lacking in wisdom.

借着圣灵所赐，关于基督的奥秘（召会）的启示，
与神奥秘中的智慧有关。林前二章六至七节保罗说，
“然而在长成的人中，我们也讲智慧，但不是这世
代的智慧，也不是这世代有权有位正被废掉之人的
智慧。我们讲的，乃是从前所隐藏，神奥秘中的智
慧， 就 是 神 在 万 世 以 前， 为 使 我 们 得 荣 耀 所 预 定
的。”神的智慧就是基督，（一 24，）祂是隐藏的
奥秘，乃是在万世以前，在永远里，为使我们得荣
耀所预定、预派、预立的。按照二章七节，神的智
慧是在奥秘中；这是奥秘的智慧。神的智慧是隐藏
的智慧，也是在万世以前，为使我们得荣耀所预定
的智慧。神的智慧是我们的定命，而这定命是神预
先所决定的。在永远里神就决定我们的定命。祂预

The revelation of the mystery of Christ, the church, by the Holy Spirit
concerns God’s wisdom in a mystery. In 1 Corinthians 2:6 and 7 Paul says,
“We do speak wisdom among those who are full-grown, yet a wisdom not of
this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are being brought to nought; but
we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden,
which God predestined before the ages for our glory.” God’s wisdom is
Christ (1 Cor. 1:24), who is the hidden mystery predestined, pre-designated,
and foreordained before the ages, in eternity, for our glory. According to
2:7, God’s wisdom is in a mystery; it is a mysterious wisdom. God’s wisdom
is the wisdom which has been hidden and which God predestinated
before the ages for our glory. God’s wisdom is our destiny, and this destiny
was determined by God, decided by Him, beforehand. In eternity God
determined our destiny. He predestined His wisdom to be for our glory. This
means that in eternity He decided that His wisdom would be our destiny
and glory.

As God’s center and as our portion for our enjoyment, Christ is God’s
wisdom in a mystery, a wisdom that is deep and profound, beyond human
understanding. Within God there is something which Paul describes as
wisdom in a mystery. This wisdom has been hidden and predestined before
the ages for our glory. As believers we have a destiny, and this destiny is
the ultimate and consummate portion of our enjoyment. God’s wisdom in a
mystery has not only been hidden but also predestined by God to become our
destiny for our glory. (The Conclusion of the New Testament, pp. 91, 2089)
When we live in the oneness of the Body of Christ and express this Body
in the various local churches, the result will be: (1) God’s crushing of Satan
under our feet (Rom. 16:20a), (2) our enjoying the grace of Christ and the
peace of God (v. 20b), and (3) the giving of glory to the only wise God (vv. 2527). This is the peak of our church life. No matter how many saints or local
churches there are on earth, in the various places we all give glory to the only
wise God. (CWWL, 1990, vol. 3, “A Deeper Study of the Divine Dispensing,” p.
442)

In Matthew 11:19 some authorities read “children” instead of “works” (see
Luke 7:35). Being children is a matter of life. We are not students of wisdom
caring merely for the knowledge of wisdom. We are children of wisdom
caring for the life of wisdom. Because we have the life of Christ, we have the
life of wisdom. As children of wisdom, the believers in Christ justify Christ
and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom.

Christ is not only God’s power, but also God’s wisdom (1 Cor. 1:24). He
has been made wisdom to us from God (1 Cor. 1:30). Wisdom is for planning
and purposing, whereas power is for carrying out and accomplishing what
is planned and purposed. In God’s salvation Christ crucified is both God’s

Moreover, wisdom and knowledge refer to all the “stories” of God. All the
stories of God are wisdom and knowledge. All the wisdom and knowledge
pertaining to God’s stories are hidden in this Christ who is the mystery
of God. Therefore, Colossians 2:6-7 indicates that we who have received
Christ Jesus the Lord should walk in Him and be rooted and built up in
Him.

God is the unique source of wisdom and knowledge. All the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge are hidden in the Christ who is the mystery of God.
Because the church in Colossae had been invaded by pagan philosophy, Paul was
helping the Colossians to trace wisdom and knowledge to their true source in God.
Christ is the mystery of God, who alone is the source of all wisdom and knowledge.

The fact that wisdom and knowledge are embodied in Christ is proved
by His spoken words, especially those recorded in the Gospels of Matthew
and John. In these books, the Lord spoke about the kingdom and about life.
The Lord’s words recorded in these books contain the highest philosophy.
None of the teachings of the philosophers, including the ethical teachings
of Confucius, compare to them. The concept in the Lord’s words is deep and
profound. Anyone who makes a thorough study of philosophy will have to
admit that the highest philosophy is that found in the teachings of Jesus
Christ. Truly all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in Him. Since
wisdom and knowledge are stored up in Christ as a treasure, we cannot have
wisdom and knowledge unless we have Christ.

If we exercise our being to contact the Lord, Christ as the life-giving Spirit
will saturate our spirit and our mind. Then we also will have in our experience
the wisdom and knowledge that are hidden in Christ. In this way we will
experience Him as the mystery of God. We should not be like the Colossians,
who allowed pagan philosophy to defraud them of the wisdom and knowledge
hidden in Christ. (The Conclusion of the New Testament, pp. 3557-3558)

Christ as the wisdom of God flows unceasingly from God to us to be our
present and practical wisdom in our experience. As we face certain problems
and realize that we do not know how to handle them, we should apply Christ
as our wisdom. If we remain with the Lord to receive His dispensing, He will
be transmitted into us as the wisdom to handle all kinds of problems and
matters. This is to apply Christ as wisdom in our daily life.

智慧可领会为作事的方法（路）。我们若有智慧，
就会知道正确的作事方法；但我们若没有智慧，我们作
事的方法就是愚昧的。我们在日常生活中作事要有最好
的方法，就必须有智慧。事实上，基督作为信徒的智慧
乃是神圣的道路。因此，林前一章三十节的智慧，等于
约翰十四章六节的道路，在这节主耶稣说，“我就是道
路。”神的道路就是祂的智慧。我们若享受基督并有分

Wisdom may be understood as the way to do things. If we have wisdom,
we will know the proper way to do things, but if we are not wise, our way
of doing things will be foolish. In order to have the best way to do things in
our daily life, we must have wisdom. Christ as wisdom to the believers is
actually the divine way. Hence, wisdom in 1 Corinthians 1:30 is equal to the
way in John 14:6, a verse in which the Lord Jesus says, “I am the way.” God’s
way is His wisdom. If we enjoy Christ and participate in Him, we will have
Him as our wisdom, as our way. This wisdom comes from our enjoyment of
Christ. Day by day and hour by hour we should live in the spirit and exercise
the spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. If we do this, we will enjoy
Christ and have Him as our wisdom, that is, our way of doing things. (The

wisdom “to us from God.” The expression to us from God indicates something
present, practical, experiential, and ongoing in the way of transmission.
For Christ to become wisdom to us from God indicates that there is the
transmission of Christ as wisdom from God to us for our daily experience. Paul
composed verse 30 in the particular way he did in order to point out to the
believers that Christ should continually become wisdom to us from God.

God Himself in Christ is wisdom to us, constantly transmitting Christ, His
wisdom, into us as the divine element that constitutes us wise persons.

Christ became wisdom to us from God as three vital things in God’s
salvation: (1) righteousness (for our past), …(2) sanctification (for our
present), …and (3) redemption (for our future)…. It is of God that we
participate in such a complete and perfect salvation, which makes our entire
being—spirit, soul, and body—organically one with Christ and makes Christ
everything to us.
On the one hand, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption cover
three stages of God’s salvation: regeneration in the spirit (for our past),
sanctification in the soul (for our present), and redemption in the body (for
our future). On the other hand, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
refer to three aspects of the nature of God’s salvation that we need to
experience daily in our Christian living and work. Today in our living and
work we need Christ as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Every
day we need to be righteous, we need to be sanctified, and we need to be
redeemed in all matters of our living. Christ, the wisdom of God transmitted
into our being, is doing everything within us to make us righteous in our
deeds and to sanctify us in our nature. Hence, whatever we do must be
righteous and holy. Not only so, Christ as the wisdom of God redeems us from
all things other than God (1 Pet. 1:18). Every day our living and work must
be righteous, holy, and redeemed. Even our entire being should be righteous,
holy, and redeemed. (The Conclusion of the New Testament, pp. 3122-3123)

The book of Daniel indicates that all nations on earth are under the rule

of knowledge have created many opportunities for God’s wisdom to be
manifested in a multifarious way, that is, in various ways and aspects and
from many angles. The

Greek word translated “multifarious” indicates that God’s wisdom has many
sides, aspects, and directions. Only through problems can all the aspects of God’s
wisdom be manifested. In Ephesians 3:10 Paul declares that God’s multifarious
wisdom is made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies through
the church. The church is the Body of Christ, the joint-heirs, and the jointpartakers. The church is composed of those who once were ruined, corrupted,
and damaged. Before we were saved, we were vipers, poisonous serpents.
Furthermore, we were dead in trespasses and sins. Moreover, we were scattered
and divided, utterly unable to be one. Thus, all the members of the church were
in a hopeless situation. Nevertheless, God in His wisdom is able to make us the
church. Now we are not only redeemed, saved, cleansed, freed, liberated, and
regenerated—we are also united. We are one with God and with one another.
Therefore, we are the church. The church is God’s greatest boast. Although you
may not care that much for the church, God cares very much for the church.
Sometimes God may say, “Look, Satan, I have taken the very people whom you
have ruined and I have made them into the church. Do you have the wisdom to
do such a thing? You do not have this wisdom, but I have it.”

The church through which God’s wisdom is so marvelously displayed
is God’s masterpiece. In the eyes of God the most wonderful thing in the
universe is the church, for through the church God’s multifarious wisdom
is made known to Satan and his angels. The day is coming when Satan and
his angels will be put to shame. They will realize that everything they have
done has given God the opportunity to manifest His wisdom. In the same
principle, our failures, mistakes, defeats, and wrongdoings have also given
God opportunities to display His wisdom. (Life-study of Ephesians, pp. 268270, 272-273)

This indicates that God is a skillful designer and a top craftsman. As such an
Architect and Builder, God certainly has not designed and built a physical city.

Ephesians 2:10 reveals that the church is God’s masterpiece. The Greek
word for masterpiece, poiema, means something which has been written
or composed as a poem. Poetry expresses the writer’s wisdom. Through
the church as a poem written by Him God makes known His multifarious
wisdom (Eph. 3:10). The New Jerusalem, as the ultimate consummation of
the church, will be full of wisdom. God designed the New Jerusalem with His
wisdom, and this city will display His wisdom for eternity. (The Conclusion
of the New Testament, p. 2029)

Today’s Reading

To say that the New Jerusalem is a physical city depreciates God’s
wisdom and belittles Him as the eternal, wise Architect. If we realize that
the New Jerusalem is a sign which signifies spiritual and divine things, we
shall begin to see the wisdom of God in this city. God is a wise Designer
and Craftsman who designs such a city to be a full manifestation of His
multifarious wisdom. Furthermore, in His wisdom God constructs the New
Jerusalem by dispensing Himself as the Architect and Builder into our
being.

神的设计启示在以弗所书。…在一章和三章，保
罗说到神的经纶，神的经纶乃是神有设计的计划。
无疑的，神不会设计一座物质的城，神也没有打算
要建造一座物质的城。神乃是设计并建造了一个属
灵的实体，作祂团体的彰显。
活神的城，是旧约圣徒从远处望见，羡慕并等候
的。（来十一 13 下，16 上，10 上。）…〔亚伯拉罕〕
象旅客，甚至象放逐者，亡命国外者，寄居在应许
之地，羡慕一个更美、属天的家乡。（16。）以撒
和雅各同样跟随他的脚踪，在地上生活如同客旅和
寄居的，等候神所建筑，那座有根基的城。
在已过的永远里，三一神定了一个计划；历代以
来，祂一直在完成祂的经纶。子借着成为肉体而来，
在地上生活三十三年半，死在十字架上，复活，然后
升天。自祂升天之后，那灵一直在作许多奇妙的事。
神当然不会建造一座物质的城给祂的赎民居住，来作
这一切事的总结。新耶路撒冷是一座城，但不是一座
物质的城。（新约总论第八册，一五三至一五四页。）
希伯来十一章十节指明，神是新耶路撒冷的设计者
并建筑者。…这城就是活神的城，属天的耶路撒冷，
（十二 22，）在上的耶路撒冷，（加四 26，）圣城
新耶路撒冷，（启二一 2，三 12，）是神为祂子民所
预备的；（来十一 16；）也是神的帐幕，神要在其中
与人同住，直到永远。（启二一 3。）列祖怎样等候
这座城，我们也照样寻求她。（来十三 14。）

God’s design is revealed in the book of Ephesians…. In chapters 1 and
3 Paul speaks of God’s economy, which is God’s plan with a design. Surely,
God has not designed a material city, and He has no intention of building a
material city. God has designed and built a spiritual entity for His corporate
expression.
The city of the living God was seen from afar, longed after, and waited for
by the Old Testament saints (Heb. 11:13b, 16a, 10a)…. [Abraham] sojourned
in the land of promise as a pilgrim, even as an exile and an expatriate,
longing after a better country, a heavenly one (Heb. 11:16). Isaac and Jacob
followed him in the same steps, living on earth as strangers and sojourners
and waiting for the God-built city of foundations.
In eternity past the Triune God made a plan, and throughout the centuries
He has been carrying out His economy. The Son came through incarnation,
lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, died on the cross, was
resurrected, and then ascended. Since His ascension, the Spirit has been
working out many wonderful things. Surely, as the conclusion of all this, God
will not build a material city for His redeemed people to live in. The New
Jerusalem is a city, but it is not a physical, material city.

Hebrews 11:10 indicates that God is the Architect and the Builder
of the New Jerusalem….This is “the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem” (Heb. 12:22), “the Jerusalem above” (Gal. 4:26), “the holy city,
New Jerusalem” (Rev. 21:2; 3:12), which God has prepared for His people
(Heb. 11:16), and the tabernacle of God in which God will dwell with men for
eternity (Rev. 21:3). As the patriarchs waited for this city, so we also seek it
(Heb. 13:14).

想想新约里所启示的新耶路撒冷。在神以外，谁
Consider the New Jerusalem as it is revealed in the New Testament. Who
能设计这样一座城？唯有神这至高的设计者能设计 other than God is capable of designing such a city? Only God as the supreme

Outline
§Day 1

壹 箴言是智慧人之言语的汇集，（一 1 ～ 7，） I. Proverbs is a collection of the words of the wise (1:1-7); it
stresses the wisdom that man receives of God through his
强调人借着接触神，从神所得的智慧，（参
contacting of God (cf. 2 Chron. 1:10-12; Col. 2:2-3; 1:28-29),
代 下 一 10 ～ 12， 西 二 2 ～ 3， 一 28 ～
and it teaches man how to behave and build up his character
29，）并且教导人如何行事为人，在为人
in his human life (cf. Phil. 1:20; Gal. 6:7-8; 5:22-26):
生活中建立他们的性格（参腓一 20，加六
7 ～ 8，五 22 ～ 26）：
一 因为箴言主要是由律法时代两位犹大王（所罗
门和希西家）所收集，所以箴言这卷书可视为
律法的辅助。
二 律法是神的描绘，要求神的百姓遵守，使他们
能成为神的复本，好叫神得着彰显和荣耀—参
罗八 4。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 9 周纲要 - 第 1 页

A. Since the proverbs were collected mainly by two kings (Solomon
and Hezekiah) in the age of the law, the book of Proverbs may be
considered a subsidiary to the law.
B. The law is the portrait of God; as such, it demands that God’s people
keep it so that they may be made copies of God for His expression and
glorification—cf. Rom. 8:4.
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 9 - Page 1

三 箴言是律法的辅助，指导人如何照着神的属性，
就是照着神的所是，行事为人并建立自己。

C. Proverbs, as a subsidiary to the law, instructs people how to behave
and how to build themselves up according to God’s attributes, that is,
according to what God is.

贰 箴言独有的特点，是向我们陈明古时许多 II. Proverbs has a particular character; that is, it presents to us the
words of wisdom by many ancient wise men, which is unanimously
智慧人智慧的话，所有读这卷书的人一致
considered good by all the people who read it; but we have to
认为这些话是好的；但我们必须领悟，箴
realize that what the book of Proverbs is to us depends upon what
言之于我们是如何，乃在于我们是哪一种
kind of persons we are and by what way we take it:
人，以及我们以何种方式接受箴言：
一 我们若是一个讲求伦理道德的人，有刚强的心
思，并且渴慕象一个真正有道德的人那样完全，
这卷书的确会帮助我们在追求完全的事上成功；
然而，这卷书并不能帮助我们成为一个照着神那
住在我们里面的灵而活在灵中的人（提后四 22，
罗 一 9， 二 29， 七 6， 八 4 ～ 6，9 ～ 11，16，
林 前 十 六 18， 林 后 二 13 ～ 14， 腓 三 3， 加 五
15 ～ 17，22 ～ 25，六 18，弗五 18，六 18）：
1 在旧约里，约伯满足于自己的纯全，满足于自己属
人完全的追求；但这不是神在他身上所要的，反而
顶替了神在他身上所要的；这就成了神的仇敌，使
他这个神所创造的人受拦阻，不能完成神的定旨。
2 神的定旨是要约伯得着神，使神得荣耀，得彰显；
我们对神最高的事奉，就是得着神到极点，被神充
满，以彰显神而使祂得荣耀—腓三 7 ～ 8，12，赛
四三 7，林前六 20，十 31，参约十七 1。
3 神创造人的定旨，是要人得着祂，被祂充满，好彰
显祂，而不是彰显属人的完全；所以神来拆毁约
伯在属人完全上的成功；然后神进来向约伯启示祂
自己，指明祂自己才是约伯所该追求、得着并彰显

A. If we are ethical persons with a strong mind and have a desire
to be perfect as genuine moral persons, surely this book would
help us to make a success in our pursuit of perfection; however, it
would not help us to be persons who live in our spirit according to
the Spirit of God (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 1:9; 2:29; 7:6; 8:4-6, 9-11, 16; 1
Cor. 16:18; 2 Cor. 2:13-14; Phil. 3:3; Gal. 5:15-17, 22-25; 6:18; Eph.
5:18; 6:18):
1. In the Old Testament Job was satisfied with his integrity, with his pursuit
of human perfection, but that was not what God wanted of him; rather,
it replaced what God wanted of him, and it became an enemy of God,
frustrating Job as a man created by God to fulfill God’s purpose.

2. God’s purpose was for Job to gain Him for the glorification of God, the
expression of God; the highest service that we can render to God is for us
to gain God to the uttermost, to be filled with God, in order to express God
for His glory—Phil. 3:7-8, 12; Isa. 43:7; 1 Cor. 6:20; 10:31; cf. John 17:1.
3. God’s purpose in creating man is to have man gain Him and be filled
with Him to be His expression, not an expression of human perfection;
therefore, the success of Job in human perfection was torn down by God;
then God came in to reveal Himself to Job, indicating that He Himself is

的—伯四二 1 ～ 6，十 13，弗三 9，腓三 14，林后
三 18，四 16 ～ 18。

【周二、周三】
二 我们来到箴言这卷书跟前，需要在我们的灵里祷
告，将自己从心思转向灵；（弗六 18，路十八 1，
西四 2；）我们若这样来到箴言跟前，就会凭着
新人来摸主的话，我们过生活就不是凭着我们
天然的人、我们的旧人、和我们的己，乃是凭着
那活在我们灵里，作我们生命和人位的主耶稣。
（提后四 22，约六 57，63，耶十五 16。）
三 我们必须拒绝自我修养，定罪旧造天然人的建
立，（参太十六 24，罗六 6，加二 20，）并借着
操练我们的灵同着那灵，在祷告的灵里接触话，
作为新造重生的人（弗四 22 ～ 24，林后四 16）
来读箴言；这样，箴言里的话就会对我们成为灵
和生命。（约六 63，太四 4，弗六 17 ～ 18。）
四 我们新约信徒该相信，箴言是圣经中神的圣言
的一部分；诗人说，“我要向你的诫命举手，
这些诫命是我所爱的；”（诗一一九 48；）向
神的话举手，指明我们热诚欢乐地接受它，并
对它说“阿们”。（尼八 5 ～ 6。）

【周四】
五 箴言是神的呼出，给我们吸入，叫我们从神得
着生命的供应；圣经是神的呼出；当我们借着
各样的祷告读任何经文的时候，这祷读就是我
们吸入神的气—提后三 16，弗六 17 ～ 18：
1 箴言里一切的话都是神的呼出，而神的呼出完全具
体化在基督里；我们读箴言时，需要吸入神所呼出
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 9 周纲要 - 第 3 页

what Job should pursue, gain, and express—Job 42:1-6; 10:13; Eph. 3:9;
Phil. 3:14; 2 Cor. 3:18; 4:16-18.

§Day 2 & Day 3

B. When we come to the book of Proverbs, we need to turn ourselves
from the mind to the spirit by praying in our spirit (Eph. 6:18; Luke
18:1; Col. 4:2); if we come to Proverbs in this way, we will be touching
the Word by the new man, and we will live a life not by our natural
man, by our old man, and by our self but by the Lord Jesus, who is
our life and person living in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; John 6:57, 63; Jer.
15:16).
C. We must reject self-cultivation, condemn the building up of the
natural man in the old creation (cf. Matt. 16:24; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20),
and come to Proverbs as a regenerated man in the new creation (Eph.
4:22-24; 2 Cor. 4:16) by exercising our spirit with the Spirit to contact
the word in the spirit of prayer so that the word in Proverbs will
become spirit and life to us (John 6:63; Matt. 4:4; Eph. 6:17-18).
D. As New Testament believers, we should believe that Proverbs is a part
of the holy word in God’s Holy Scriptures; the psalmist says, “I will lift
up my hand to Your commandments, which I love” (Psa. 119:48); to
lift up our hand unto the word of God is to indicate that we receive it
warmly and gladly and that we say Amen to it (Neh. 8:5-6).

§Day 4

E. Proverbs is the breath of God for us to breathe in that we may receive
the life supply from God; the Bible is God’s exhaling; when we read
any verse by means of all prayer, this pray-reading becomes our
inhaling of God’s breath—2 Tim. 3:16; Eph. 6:17-18:

1. All the words in Proverbs are God’s breathing, which is altogether
embodied in Christ; as we read Proverbs, we need to inhale all that God
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 9 - Page 3

的一切；借着吸入箴言里神圣的气，我们越接受说
话之神的气，就越享受基督—提后三 16，约二十
22。
2 以色列人受嘱遵守诫命、律例和典章，今天我们则
需要持守基督；借着接受基督、持守基督、紧联于
基督，我们就会赢得祂、享受祂并活祂；我们需要
爱基督、持守基督、教导基督、披戴基督、并书写
基督—申六 1，5 ～ 9，腓三 9，一 19 ～ 21 上。
3 圣经是神的呼出，（提后三 16，）所以我们该借着
各样的祷告，（弗六 17 ～ 18，）接受神的话，包
括箴言这卷书，借此吸入圣经；我们教导圣经时，
应当将神呼到人里面。

六 我们读箴言时，该在灵里被神的丰满所充满；（弗
五 18 ～ 19，三 19；）不仅如此，我们该用重生
的灵，（罗八 16，）在新约生命的灵里，（2，）
调和着祷告来读箴言，（弗六 17 ～ 18，）好用
灵和生命，与话调和。（参约六 63。）

has exhaled, all that He has breathed out; by inhaling the divine breath in
Proverbs, the more we receive the breath of the speaking God, the more
we will enjoy Christ—2 Tim. 3:16; John 20:22.

2. Whereas the children of Israel were charged to keep the commandments,
statutes, and ordinances, we today need to keep Christ; by taking Christ,
keeping Christ, and holding fast to Him, we will gain Him, enjoy Him, and
live Him; we need to love Christ, keep Christ, teach Christ, wear Christ,
and write Christ—Deut. 6:1, 5-9; Phil. 3:9; 1:19-21a.
3. Because the Scriptures are the breathing out of God, the exhaling of God (2
Tim. 3:16), we should inhale the Scriptures by receiving the word of God,
including the book of Proverbs, by means of all prayer (Eph. 6:17-18); as
we are teaching the Bible, we should be exhaling God into people.

F. We should read Proverbs by being filled with the fullness of God in
our spirit (Eph. 5:18-19; 3:19); furthermore, we should read Proverbs
in the New Testament Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), with our regenerated
spirit (v. 16), and by mingling prayer with our reading (Eph. 6:17-18)
in order to mingle the words with spirit and life (cf. John 6:63).

叁 照着神的经纶，箴言的原则如金块，细则 III. According to God’s economy, the big proverbs, like nuggets,
and the small ones, like gems, are not for us to build up our
如珠宝，这些都不是为着建立我们的旧

人；反之，这些乃是叫我们建立我们的新

§Day 5

A. We need to receive the living and operative word of God with a
praying spirit so that we can build up our new man and so that we
may be able to discern our spirit from our soul—Heb. 4:12:
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 9 - Page 4

1 仇敌的计谋总是要使我们的灵与我们的魂搀杂在一起；
搀杂是我们最大的难处；我们越被神的光—神的同在—
所充满，就越认识神，也就越宝贵干净过于宝贵能力—
太五 8，路十一 34 ～ 36，诗一一九 105，130。
2 除去这搀杂的路是借着圣灵的启示；灵与魂的分开，
乃是有神的话光照我们，在我们里面照亮，给我们
看见我们心中的思念和主意—三六 9，彼前二 9。
3 在神话语的光中所看见的，也就在光中杀死了；光
杀死，乃是基督徒经历中最大的事；灵与魂的分开
乃是靠着光照—赛六 1 ～ 8，徒九 1 ～ 4，十三 9 ～
10。
4 启示就是我们看见神所看见的；启示就是神开我们
的眼睛，叫我们认识我们的主意，认识我们里面最
深处的思念，象祂认识我们一样；神只要将我们的
思念显露，将我们心中的主意给我们看一下，我们
的灵与魂就分开了。
5 若没有祷读，箴言就仅仅是格言的汇集，但我们带
着祷告读箴言，也就是祷读箴言时，我们的祷读就
使所有的箴言对我们成为灵和生命。

二 我们不该来到箴言跟前作一个守字句的人，乃
该作一个寻求神的人；我们应当作全心寻求神，
借着寻求神的面而求祂的恩，求神用脸光照我
们，并且行在神面前的人—诗二七 8，一○五 4，

1. The enemy’s strategy is always to mix our spirit up with our soul; our
greatest problem is our mixture; the more we know God by being filled
with His light, His presence, the more we will treasure purity over
power—Matt. 5:8; Luke 11:34-36; Psa. 119:105, 130.
2. The way to purge such mixture is through the revelation of the Holy
Spirit; the dividing of the soul and the spirit occurs when God’s word
illuminates us, shining within us to reveal the thoughts and intentions of
our heart—36:9; 1 Pet. 2:9.

3. Whatever we see under the shining of God from the word of God is killed
by the light; the greatest thing in the Christian experience is the killing
that comes from light; the dividing of the soul and the spirit comes from
the shining—Isa. 6:1-8; Acts 9:1-4; 13:9-10.

4. Revelation is seeing what God sees; it is God opening our eyes to see our
intentions and the deepest thoughts in our being as God sees them; as
soon as God exposes our thoughts and shows us the intentions of our
heart, our soul will be separated, divided, from our spirit.
5. Apart from pray-reading, the book of Proverbs is merely a collection of
proverbs, but when we read Proverbs prayerfully, that is, when we prayread Proverbs, our pray-reading causes all the proverbs to become words
of spirit and life to us.

B. We should not come to Proverbs as a letter-keeper but as a Godseeker; we should be those who seek God with all our heart, who seek
God’s favor by entreating His countenance, who ask God to cause His
face to shine upon us, and who walk in God’s presence—Psa. 27:8;
105:4; 119:2, 10, 58, 135, 168; 2 Cor. 3:6.

Adam through our natural birth, and the new man is of Christ
by a new birth, regeneration; we need to live a life of putting
off the old man and putting on the new man; according to
God’s economy, Proverbs should not be used to cultivate
and build up our old man but to cultivate and build up our
regenerated new man:

A. In order to enter into the intrinsic significance of the book of Proverbs
according to God’s economy, we need to be those who are living
according to the new creation (Gal. 6:15); the old creation is our old
man in Adam (Eph. 4:22), our natural being by birth, without God’s
life and the divine nature; the new creation is the new man in Christ
(v. 24), our being that is regenerated by the Spirit (John 3:6), having
God’s life and the divine nature wrought into it (v. 36; 2 Pet. 1:4),
having Christ as its constituent (Col. 3:10-11), and having become a
new constitution.

§Day 6

B. In our spirit there is the marvelous, wonderful, processed, allinclusive, sevenfold intensified, life-giving Spirit (Phil. 1:19; Rev. 4:5;
5:6; 1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:6; Rom. 8:16); when we exercise our spirit
to contact Christ as the living Word of God (John 1:1; 5:39-40) in the
written word of God (10:35), He becomes the applied word of God as
the Spirit to us (Eph. 6:17-18); then our reading of any word in the
Bible will become spirit and life to us to revive us (John 6:63).
C. We need to turn the Bible from a book that apparently teaches us
to cultivate the self and to build up the natural man into a book
that actually is full of light, life, spirit, and spiritual nourishment by
receiving it in a spirit and atmosphere of prayer; this will tear down

Proverbs is a collection of the words of the wise. The main writers and
collectors are Solomon, who wrote three thousand proverbs (1 Kings 4:32;
cf. Eccl. 12:9), and Hezekiah, who added some proverbs of the forefathers in
chapters 25 through 29.
The theme of Proverbs is that this book consists of words of wisdom teaching
people how to behave and how to build up their character in the human life.
Humanly speaking, this is the great subject, and all religions and philosophies
are concerned with it. The matters of behavior and the building up of character
have been the subjects of teaching ever since humankind came into being.

Proverbs stresses wisdom that man receives of God through his contacting
of God and that teaches man how to behave in his human life. (Life-study of
Proverbs, pp. 1-3)

Today’s Reading

Since the proverbs were collected mainly by two kings of Judah in the age
of the law, the book of Proverbs may be considered a subsidiary to the law.
The law is the portrait of God, demanding God’s people to keep it that they
might be made copies of God for His expression and glorification. Proverbs,
as a subsidiary to the law, helps God’s people to keep the law.
Because the law was written according to what God is, the law tells man
how to behave and how to build up himself according to God’s attributes.
God is love and light, and God is holy and righteous. These are some of
God’s attributes. For God to create man in His own image means that God

这点来看，箴言是律法的辅助，指导人如何照着神

箴言…独有的特点，是向我们陈明古时许多智慧
人智慧的话，所有读这卷书的人一致认为这些话是
好的；但这是否真的好，乃在于你是哪一种读者。

经纶，就是产生并建造基督的身体，终极完成那作

约伯正是这样一个人。他满足于自己的纯全，满足
于自己属人完全的追求。但这不是神在他身上所要
的，反而顶替了神在他身上所要的；这就成了神的
仇敌，使他这个神所创造的人受拦阻，不能完成神
的定旨。神创造人的定旨，是要人被祂充满，好彰

在属人完全上的成功。神这样的拆毁，也把约伯这
人拆毁了。约伯感到困惑，不知如何是好。然后神
进来向约伯启示祂自己，指明祂自己才是约伯所该

created man according to what He is, that is, according to His attributes. The
law, which was written according to God’s attributes, demands that man
behave and build himself up according to God. Regarding this, Proverbs is
a subsidiary part of the law, instructing people how to behave and how to
build themselves up according to what God is. This helps us to see what the
position of Proverbs probably is in the divine revelation in the Scriptures.
The book of Proverbs … has a particular character; that is, it presents to
us the words of wisdom by many ancient wise men, which is unanimously
considered good by all the people who read it. But whether it is really good
or not depends upon what kind of reader you are.

If you are an ethical person with a strong mind and have a desire to
be perfect as a genuine moral person, surely this book would help you to
make a success in your pursuit of perfection. But it helps you to cultivate
yourself, that is, to cultivate the human “bright virtue” created for man by
God according to His attributes, that is, according to what He is. However,
it does not help you to be a person who lives in his spirit according to
the Spirit of God who dwells in you for the accomplishment of God’s
eternal economy, that is, to produce and build up the Body of Christ which
consummates the New Jerusalem as God’s heart’s desire and ultimate goal.
In the Old Testament Job was exactly such a person. He was satisfied with
his integrity, with his pursuit of human perfection. But that was not what
God wanted of him; rather, it replaced what God wanted of him and then
it became an enemy of God frustrating him, a man created by God to fulfill
God’s purpose. God’s purpose in creating man is to have man be filled with
Him to be His expression, not an expression of human perfection. So the
success of Job in human perfection was torn down by God. In this tearing
down by God, God tore down Job also. Job was perplexed, not knowing
what to do. Then God came in to reveal Himself to Job, indicating that He
Himself is what Job should pursue, gain, and express. Then Job had a big
turn from pursuing human perfection to pursue God Himself. (Life-study of
Proverbs, pp. 2-5)

If you are a person who is a law-keeper, surely you will appreciate all
the proverbs in this book as words of wise men, thinking that they could
help you to be a good or even better law-keeper. If so, you just make all the
proverbs many, many laws and fall into the snare of keeping the law as many
Jews do, who do not know God’s purpose in the dispensation of His law, that
is, to expose fallen man’s weakness.

If you are a person who loves the Lord and pursues Christ, not selfperfection, and who loves the Lord’s word in the entire Bible and reads it
with a praying spirit, not for the seeking of the doctrine of letters but for
seeking the Spirit and word of life, not to get any help for self-cultivation
but for the nourishment of your spirit that you may live a Christian life

神不是要我们只在字句上寻求知识、道理、真理、
神学和所谓的启示；神乃是要我们寻求祂，使我们
得着祂，并被祂自己所充满，作祂的彰显。祂是那
灵，我们是在我们的灵里敬拜并接触祂。字句杀死
人，唯有那灵赐人生命。主对我们所说的话，对我
们该成为灵和生命。（约六 63。）我们若凭字句而
不凭那灵和生命研读圣经，不论是读哪一部分，都
会使圣经成为一本字句的书。今天大多数的基督徒，
将那属于灵和生命的新约，当作属于字句的旧约。
对使徒保罗而言，甚至旧约也象新约一样，是属于
灵和生命。太多的基督徒将新约当作字句的箴言、
训辞、劝勉和指导。我们的生命读经已使全部旧约
神的话，成为灵与生命的书。借此我们必须领悟，
箴言之于我们是如何，乃在于我们是哪一种人，以
及我们以何种方式接受箴言。

God does not want us just to seek the knowledge, doctrine, truth, theology,
and so-called revelation in letters. God wants us to seek after Him that we
may gain Him and that He may fill us up with Himself for His expression. He is
the Spirit, and we worship Him and contact Him in our spirit. The letter kills,
but the Spirit gives life. The word spoken to us by the Lord should become
the Spirit and the life to us (John 6:63). If we study the Bible by the way of
letters, not by the way of the Spirit and of life, we make the Bible, regardless
of what part, a book of letters. Most Christians today have made the New
Testament of the Spirit and of life the Old Testament of letters. To Paul the
apostle even the Old Testament was like the New Testament, of the Spirit and
of life. Too many Christians have made the New Testament proverbs, precepts,
exhortations, and instructions of letters. Our life-studies have made all of the
Old Testament, as the Word of God, books of the Spirit and of life. By this we
have to realize that what the book of Proverbs would be to us depends upon
what kind of persons we are and by what way we take it.

我们新约信徒该相信，箴言是圣经中神的圣言
的 一 部 分。 … 我 们 该 认 识 箴 言 是 神 的 呼 出， 给 我
们 吸 入， 叫 我 们 从 神 得 着 生 命 的 供 应。（ 提 后 三

在新约生命的灵里，（罗八 2，）调和着祷告来读箴
言，好用灵和生命，与话调和。（参约六 63。）
我能见证，只要与主交通几分钟以后，我就得着
喂养、滋养与挑旺。然后我来读圣经，每个字都成

As New Testament believers, we should believe that Proverbs is a part
of the holy word in God’s Holy Scriptures. We should realize that Proverbs
is the breath of God for us to breathe in that we may receive the life supply
from God (2 Tim. 3:16). Next, we should read Proverbs by being filled with
the fullness of God in our spirit (Eph. 5:18-19), in the New Testament Spirit
of life (Rom. 8:2), with our regenerated spirit, and by pray-reading to mingle
it with spirit and life (cf. John 6:63).

I can testify that after just a few minutes of fellowship with the Lord, I am
fed, nourished, and stirred up. Then when I come to the Bible, every word
becomes a gem. We all need to read the book of Proverbs in this way. Then
every word of Proverbs will become spirit and life to us. Every word will be
living and become a gem to strengthen our life of pursuing Christ for the
fulfillment of God’s economy in producing and building up the Body of Christ.

Ephesians 4:22-24 tells us clearly that a believer in Christ has two men—
the old man and the new man. The old man is of Adam through our natural
birth, and the new man is of Christ by a new birth, regeneration.

According to my observation, very few believers in Christ and lovers of
Christ live a life of continually putting off the old man and putting on the new
man. In our daily life we mainly live an ethical life, spontaneously caring for
matters of right and wrong. Those who live such an ethical life try their best
to do what is right and to avoid doing what is wrong.

What kind of life do you live day by day? Is your daily life a life of the new
man?… In your married life is it your practice to love your wife or husband
by the new man or by the old man? We should not think that loving in the old
man is justified by God. That kind of love is according to the law, according
to the old dispensation, not according to God’s New Testament economy and
not according to the new creation. A brother may love his wife very much,
but his love may be of the old creation, not of the new creation. (Life-study of
Proverbs, p. 25)

Today’s Reading

We need to have this realization when we come to the Bible. We may study
the Bible either by the old man or by the new man. Many Christians study
the Word in a natural way, according to their old man…. If we merely exercise
our mind to get knowledge from the Word, we are reading it by the old man.

凭着新人读圣经则大不相同。在新人里的人甚至
在读圣经以前，就运用他的灵接触主。他也许认罪
说，“主，很亏欠，我这么活在我的旧人里，没有
运用我的灵接触你，没有凭着我的新人，就是你新
造的人而活。主，赦免这罪。”当我们这样就近圣
经，运用我们的灵，就有极深的感觉和感受，我们
是在就近、摸着并接触神。我不是说，圣经是神；
但我们来到圣经跟前，该是来接触神。
箴言里有许多叫人过正确为人生活的详细训辞，
每则训辞都是珠宝。即使人接受这一切珠宝，并且
成功地持守这些珠宝，他也不过是凭着修养自己而
建立自己成为完全人。但主耶稣说，无论谁要跟从
祂，就必须否认己。（太十六 24。）
我们来到神的话跟前，必须学习作就近神的人，
不是要接受格言和教训，乃是要接受滋养和光照，
使我们认识，照着神的经纶，我们该一直凭着基督
复活的大能，就是终极完成的灵，也就是基督复活
的实际，模成祂的死。（腓三 10。）
我们必须拒绝自我修养，并且定罪天然人的建立。
我们需要将圣经从教导我们培养己并建立天然人的

To read the Bible by the new man is very different. Even before coming to

not exercising my spirit to contact You, to live by my new man, as one of Your
new creation. Lord, forgive this sin.” When we approach the Bible in this
way, exercising our spirit, we have the deep feeling and sense that we are
approaching, touching, and contacting God. By this I do not mean that the
Bible is God but that in coming to the Bible we are coming to contact God.
In Proverbs there are many detailed precepts for man to live a proper
human life and … every precept is a gem. Even if a person accepts all these
gems and is successful in keeping them, he will only build up himself to be
a perfect man by cultivating the self. But the Lord Jesus said that whoever
would follow Him must deny himself (Matt. 16:24).

We must learn to come to the Word of God as those who are approaching
God, not to receive proverbs and teachings but to receive nourishment and
enlightenment, so that we may know that, according to God, we should always
be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10),
which is the consummated Spirit, who is the reality of the resurrection of Christ.
We must reject self-cultivation and condemn the building up of the natural
man. We need to turn the Bible from a book that teaches us to cultivate the
self and to build up the natural man to a book that is full of life, spirit, spiritual
nourishment, and spiritual enlightenment. This will tear down our self, break
our natural man, and supply us with the consummated Spirit of the Triune
God. Then we will live a life not by our natural man, by our old man, and by
our self but by the Lord Jesus, who is our life and person living in our spirit.

We need to learn to exercise our spirit every day in our daily life,
especially in our Bible study. We need to turn ourselves from the mind to the
spirit by praying in our spirit. If we come to the Bible in this way, we will be
touching the Word by the new man, and it will become to us a book of Spirit
and life. (Life-study of Proverbs, pp. 26, 28-29)

祷告，我们就是凭着旧人读。读圣经而没有祷告，
就是凭着旧人接触神的话。真正凭着新人读圣经，
是绝不能与祷告分开的。
“祷读”这辞使用不到三十年。（此信息讲于
一九九五年—译注。）然而，这不是说，在我们发
明这辞以前，没有祷读这样的事。许多圣徒实行祷
读主话，而没有用这辞描述他们所作的。好些寻求
的基督徒曾指出，读经上好的路就是用祷告来读。
我读过某些书说，我们该以祷告的方式读圣经。用
祷告读主的话，事实上就是祷读主的话。（箴言生
命读经，三七至三八页。）

信息选读

When we come to the Bible to contact God, we should not only read but
pray-read the Word. No matter who we are, as long as we read the Bible
without praying, we are reading by the old man. To read the Bible without
praying is to contact the Word by the old man. The genuine reading of the
Bible by the new man can never be separated from praying.
The term pray-reading has been in use for less than thirty years. This
does not mean, however, that before we invented this term, there was no
such thing as pray-reading. Many saints have practiced the pray-reading of
the Word without using this expression to describe what they were doing.
A number of seeking Christians have pointed out that the best way to read
the Bible is to read it prayerfully. I have read certain books which said that
we should read the Bible in a prayerful way. To read the Word prayerfully
actually is to pray-read the Word. (Life-study of Proverbs, pp. 26-27)

着我的祷告，约翰三章十六节对我就成了灵和生命。
我在关于箴言这些信息中的负担，是要帮助你们
凭着你们的新人，运用你们的灵祷读，来摸神的话。
祷读使圣经从字句变为灵和生命。若没有祷读，箴
言就仅仅是格言的汇集。但我们祷读箴言，我们的
祷读就使所有的箴言对我们成为灵和生命。
以弗所六章十七至十八节揭示祷读这事，我们发
明祷读这辞的根据，就是这两节经文。十七至十八
节告诉我们：“要借着各样的祷告和祈求，接受救
恩的头盔，并那灵的剑，那灵就是神的话；时时在
灵里祷告。”这里我们看见，我们接受神的话，不
仅仅该凭着运用我们的心思来领会，也该借着各样
的祷告和祈求，运用我们的灵来祷告。祷告是一般
的；祈求是专一的。…我们是借着读来接受话。然
而，只接受（读）而没有祷告，全然是在心思里。
随着我们的读，我们必须祷告。当我们凭着运用我
们的灵来祷读主话，白纸黑字的话立刻成为灵。这
样，灵与话就是一。当我们读的时候，那是话。当
我们运用我们的灵祷告，话就成为灵和生命。每当
我们来到主的话跟前，我们必须祷告，而我们的祷
告不仅仅要用心思，也该用灵。
圣经乃是神的呼出。神将祂自己当作话呼出来。
（提后三 16 上。）这就是说，圣经是神的呼出。神
在圣经里呼出来，等着我们吸入。我们读任何经文而
祷告的时候，这祷告就是我们吸入神的气。借此在我

me.” I had the feeling that I had touched God and that He had touched me.
Through my prayer John 3:16 became Spirit and life to me.

My burden in these messages on Proverbs is to help you touch the Word of God
by your new man, by exercising your spirit to pray-read. Pray-reading changes the
Bible from letters to Spirit and life. Apart from pray-reading, the book of Proverbs
is merely a collection of proverbs. But when we pray-read Proverbs, our prayreading causes all the proverbs to become words of Spirit and life to us.

Ephesians 6:17-18 unveils the matter of pray-reading, and our invention
of the term pray-reading was based on these verses. Ephesians 6:17-18
tells us to “receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which
Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at
every time in spirit.” Here we see that we should receive the word of God
not merely by exercising our mind to understand but by means of all prayer
and petition, praying by exercising our spirit. Prayer is general; petition
particular. We receive the word by reading. However, to receive (read)
without praying is altogether a matter in the mind. Along with our reading
we must pray. When we pray-read the Word by exercising our spirit, the
word in black and white immediately becomes the Spirit. In this way the
Spirit and the word are one. When we read, it is a word. When we pray with
the exercise of our spirit, the word becomes Spirit and life. Whenever we
come to the Word we must pray, and we should pray not merely with the
mind but with the spirit.

The Bible is God’s breathing. God is breathing out Himself as the word (2
Tim. 3:16a). This means that the Bible is God’s exhaling. The exhaling of God
in the Bible is waiting for us to inhale. When we read any verse and pray, this
praying becomes our inhaling of God’s breath. By this the Word becomes
Spirit and life to us in our experience. If this is not our situation, then even
in our reading of the Bible we are not in the new man but are still in the old
man. (Life-study of Proverbs, pp. 27-28)

活的、有功效、能刺入的话破碎，好使他们的灵与
魂分开。（圣经恢复本，来四 12 注 2。）

The Hebrew believers were wondering what they should do with their old
Hebrew religion…. So the writer of this book said that the word of God, that is,
what was quoted from the Old Testament, could pierce into their wondering
like a sharp two-edged sword and divide their soul from their spirit. As the
marrow is concealed deep in the joints, so the spirit is deep in the soul. The
dividing of the marrow from the joints requires mainly the breaking of the
joints. In the same principle, the dividing of the spirit from the soul requires
the breaking of the soul. The Hebrew believers’ soul, with its wondering mind,
its doubting concerning God’s way of salvation, and its considering of its own
interests, had to be broken by the living, operative, and piercing word of God
that their spirit might be divided from their soul. (Heb. 4:12, footnote 2)

In Hebrews 4:12 the word discern is used….Quite often our thoughts

and the soul wins. Before a brother begins to talk to his wife about another
brother, he has to consider, “Is this of my spirit or of my soul?” If it is of his
soul, what he says will be either gossip or criticism. If it is of his spirit, what
he says will be something led by the Lord. This shows that we have to discern
our spirit from our soul.

Actually, our person, our being, is quite complicated …because we have
three parts. We have the flesh, which is bad; the spirit, which is good; and the
soul, which is in between. We should always follow our spirit and walk in all
things according to our spirit. This is according to Romans 8:4. We should
always be on the alert to discern anything that is not of the spirit but of the
soul. Then we will remain in the spirit all the time. This is to exercise, to use,
to employ, our spirit. It is easy to know what is of the flesh and what is of the
spirit; but quite often it is a very mixed-up situation between what is of the
soul and what is of the spirit.
Our Christian walk is a very fine walk. If we are going to walk according to
our spirit, we must learn not to do things too fast or to say things too quickly.
It is safe to wait awhile. I have had this experience in writing answers to
letters. Sometimes I will write a letter and then keep it for another day
before I mail it. The next day a new thought might come to me to include in
that letter, or I may realize that I said something wrong. To wait in this way
helps us to walk according to our spirit.

Within us there is a battle between the spirit and the flesh and even more
between the spirit and the soul. So we have to exercise our spirit, to use our
spirit, that is, to fan our spirit into flame. Then we should learn how to control
our mind by setting our mind on our spirit. We should also always discern
what is of the spirit and what is of the soul. If something is not of the spirit, we
do not want to say it or do it. This is to use, to exercise, our spirit. I hope that
we will practice using our spirit until we build up a strong habit of exercising
our spirit. (CWWL, 1993, vol. 2, “The Spirit with Our Spirit,” pp. 186-187)

received by us, it becomes the word of the Spirit. Then this word of the Spirit
heard by us is the source of our faith. Faith comes from the hearing of this
applied word by the Spirit through the living Christ out of the written Bible.

Early in the morning you may read the Bible but without prayer and
without calling on the name of the Lord. Then the word of God is merely the
written word to you. It has nothing to do with you subjectively. So you have
to have some contact with the Lord by calling on Him and pray-reading the
Word. When you call on Him and pray-read the Word, right away you have
the deep sensation that Christ is living within you. Then you would say, “Lord,
I love You. I love this word here. How I love Hebrews 11:6: ‘He who comes
forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those
who diligently seek Him.’” Right away this written word becomes a living
word and then an applied word to you. Then you get into your car and drive
to your office. While you are driving, you have something living applied to
you. Then you have faith. Faith comes from this source.
All three—the written word, the living word, and the applied word—
refer to God Himself. “In the beginning was the Word…and the Word was
God” (John 1:1). The Word here is a person. God’s written word in the Bible
becomes Christ as the living word, who is applied into us as the Spirit, the
word of the Spirit. That is God Himself. The more that God is gained by you in
this way, the more He becomes your faith.

Thus, the source of faith is God. He is the One who calls the things not being
as being and gives life to the dead (Rom. 4:17). The source of faith is. God in
His written word contacted as the living word and applied as the word of the
Spirit so that we can gain the Triune God, who is able to call the things not
being as being and give life to the dead. This One is embodied in Christ and
realized as the Spirit. So faith is the Triune God embodied and realized. God
in the written word becomes the living word applied as the word of the Spirit.
Thus, God embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit is faith. (CWWL, 19941997, vol. 1, “Crystallization-study of the Epistle to the Romans,” pp. 287-289)

Thus by the Word I may feed upon Thee;
Thou dost as Spirit in my spirit live,
Thus I may drink in the spirit of Thee.

【周一】
壹 “没有异象，民就放肆”—箴二九 18 上：
一 在圣经里，“异象”是指一个特殊的景象；它
是说到一种特别的看见，即荣耀、里面的看见，
也是说到我们从神所看见的属灵景象—结一 1，

引我们、保守我们、彻底翻转我们、保守我们在
真正的一里、并给我们胆量往前—箴二九 18 上。
四 当我们看见这异象时，我们全人就从里面有个
转变，并且我们的思想、观念、态度都改变了。
五 属天的异象推动我们，加力给我们，托住我们，
赐我们忍耐，将我们带进主今日的行动里，并使
我们的生命满了意义和目的—来一 8，十二 1 ～

Scripture Reading: Prov. 29:18a; 23:23; 20:27; 4:23; 10:12b; 17:9

Hymns: 744

Outline
§Day 1

I. “Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint”—
Prov. 29:18a:
A. In the Bible vision denotes an extraordinary scene; it refers to
a special kind of seeing—a glorious, inward seeing—and to the
spiritual scenery that we see from God—Ezek. 1:1, 4-28; Dan. 7:1,
9-10, 13-14.

B. In order to have a vision, we need revelation, light, and sight—Eph.
1:17-18a.
C. The heavenly vision governs us, restricts us, controls us, directs us,
preserves us, revolutionizes us, keeps us in the genuine oneness, and
gives us the boldness to go on—Prov. 29:18a.
D. When we see this vision, our entire inner being has an inward turn,
and we are changed in thought, concept, and attitude.

E. The heavenly vision motivates us, energizes us, holds us, gives us
endurance, brings us into the Lord’s up-to-date move, and causes our
life to be full of meaning and purpose—Heb. 1:8; 12:1-2; Eph. 3:11; 2
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 10 - Page 1

2，弗三 11，提后一 9，三 10，启一 9，三 10。
六 每一个事奉主的人，都必须是有异象的人；里
面的异象会将我们事奉主的方式翻转过来—徒
二六 13 ～ 19，罗一 9。
七 我们在属天的异象之下，受指引朝向神的目的
地，我们的生活也受神的经纶所支配—腓三
13 ～ 14，提前一 4。
八 圣经中管制的异象，乃是三一神将祂自己作到
祂所拣选并救赎的人里面，为要以神圣的三一
浸透他们全人，好产生并建造基督的身体，终
极完成于新耶路撒冷—弗四 4 ～ 6，启二一 2，
9 ～ 10。

【周二】

Tim. 1:9; 3:10; Rev. 1:9; 3:10.

F. Everyone who serves the Lord must be a person with a vision; the
inner vision will revolutionize the way we serve the Lord—Acts
26:13-19; Rom. 1:9.

G. Under the heavenly vision we are directed toward God’s destination,
and our life is controlled according to God’s economy—Phil. 3:13-14;
1 Tim. 1:4.
H.The governing vision of the Bible is the Triune God working Himself
into His chosen and redeemed people in order to saturate their entire
being with the Divine Trinity for the producing and building up of the
Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem—Eph. 4:4-6; Rev.
21:2, 9-10.

§Day 2

贰 “你当买真理，不可出卖”—箴二三 23 上： II. “Buy truth, and do not sell it”—Prov. 23:23a:
一 真理是需要买的，是需要出代价的—23 节上：
1 买必须付代价。

2 我们如果要讨主的喜欢，为着真理站住，就得出代
价—参启三 18。
3 我们的心如果准备好，领受对真理的爱，不惜出
代价买真理，我们就有福了—帖后二 10 ～ 11，箴
二三 23。

二 神圣的真理是绝对的，我们必须对真理绝对，
并维持真理的绝对—约十四 6，十八 37，约叁
3 ～ 4，8：
1 对真理绝对，就是不顾情感，就是不讲关系，就是
不为着个人—太十六 24 ～ 25，彼前一 22。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 10 周纲要 - 第 2 页

A. Truth is something that we have to buy, something that has a price—v. 23a:
1. Buying requires the paying of a price.

2. If we want to please the Lord and stand for the truth, we must pay the
price—cf. Rev. 3:18.

3. If our hearts are ready to receive the love of the truth and buy the truth
at any price, we will be blessed—2 Thes. 2:10-11; Prov. 23:23.

B. The divine truth is absolute, and we must be absolute for the truth
and uphold the absoluteness of the truth—John 14:6; 18:37; 3 John
3-4, 8:

1. To be absolute for the truth means to set aside feelings, to ignore personal
relationships, and to not stand for the self—Matt. 16:24-25; 1 Pet. 1:22.
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 10 - Page 2

2 真理是唯一的标准，我们必须站在真理一边反对自
己；唯有当我们从自己里面得蒙拯救，才有可能维
持真理的绝对—约八 32，约贰 2，约叁 3 ～ 4。
3 我们应当尊重神的真理，走真理的路，一点不委屈
真理—彼后二 2。

三 为着终极完成神圣的经纶，我们需要对现有的
真理绝对—一 12：
1 现有的真理，就是信徒所已经接受，并现在持有的
真理—12 节。
2 现有的真理包括关于神永远的经纶、（弗一 10，三
9、）神圣的三一、（林后十三 14，启一 4 ～ 5、）
包罗万有之基督的身位与工作、（西二 9，16 ～
17，三 11、）终极完成之赐生命的灵、（约七 39，
林前十五 45 下，启二二 17、）神永远的生命、（约
三 15 ～ 16、）召会作为基督的身体、（弗一 22 ～
23、）和新耶路撒冷（启二一 2，10 ～ 11）的启示。
3 现有的真理包括神圣启示的高峰—这启示就是神成
为人，为要使人在生命和性情上（但不在神格上）
成为神，以产生并建造基督生机的身体，为着完成
神的经纶，好结束这个时代，并把基督带回来，设
立祂的国度—约一 12 ～ 14，约壹三 1 ～ 2，罗八 3，
一 3 ～ 4，十二 4 ～ 5，启十一 15。

【周三】

2. The truth is the unique standard, and we must stand on the side of the truth
to oppose ourselves; upholding the absoluteness of the truth is possible
only when we are delivered from ourselves—John 8:32; 2 John 2; 3 John 3-4.
3. We should honor God’s truth, take the way of the truth, and not
compromise the truth in any way—2 Pet. 2:2.

C. For the consummation of the divine economy, we need to be absolute
for the present truth—1:12:
1. The present truth is the truth that is present with the believers, which
they have already received and now possess—v. 12.

2. The present truth includes the revelation concerning the eternal economy
of God (Eph. 1:10; 3:9), the Divine Trinity (2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 1:4-5), the
person and work of the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 2:9, 16-17; 3:11), the
consummated life-giving Spirit (John 7:39; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rev. 22:17), the
eternal life of God (John 3:15-16), the church as the Body of Christ (Eph.
1:22-23), and the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2, 10-11).
3. The present truth includes the high peak of the divine revelation—the
revelation that God became man so that man may become God in life
and nature but not in the Godhead—to produce and build up the organic
Body of Christ for the fulfillment of God’s economy to close this age and
bring Christ back to set up His kingdom—John 1:12-14; 1 John 3:1-2;
Rom. 8:3; 1:3-4; 12:4-5; Rev. 11:15.

§Day 3

叁 “人的灵是耶和华的灯，鉴察人的深处”— III. “The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, / Searching all the
innermost parts of the inner being”—Prov. 20:27:
箴二十 27：
一 人的灵是神在人里面的灯—太二五 1：

1 在人重生之灵里面照耀的光，乃是神自己—约壹一 5。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 10 周纲要 - 第 3 页

A. Man’s spirit is God’s lamp within man—Matt. 25:1:

1. The light shining within man’s regenerated spirit is God Himself—1 John 1:5.
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 10 - Page 3

2 就如灯盛装光并彰显光，照样，人的灵受造是要盛
装神并彰显神。
3 为要让神圣的光照进人内里的各部分，神的灵作为
油，必须浸润（调和）作为灯芯的人的灵，并与人
的灵一同“焚烧”—罗八 16，十二 11。
4 我们若回应灵的照耀，就会照着灵而行—八 4。

二 神的灵也是灯，有祂七倍强度的照耀—启四 5：
1 我们重生的灵是有神的灵内住的灯，神的灵也
是灯。
2 人的灵与神的灵都是灯，一同光照人内里的部分—
箴二十 27，启四 5。
3 灵要光照我们魂的每一部分。

三 我们用我们的灵正确地祷告，就有照耀的灯—
弗六 18，一 17 ～ 18，五 8 ～ 9：
1 我们祷告，我们的灵就尽功用，作照耀的灯，鉴察
我们魂所有的部分—箴二十 27。
2 我们越用我们的灵祷告，就越蒙光照—林后四 6：
a 灯会照耀在我们的心思、情感和意志上。
b 我们内里的部分会彻底被主鉴察—诗一三九 23 ～ 24。
3 这样祷告以后，我们就会觉得光明、透亮、被神充
满—弗五 8 ～ 9。

【周四】

2. Just as a lamp contains light and expresses it, man’s spirit was created to
contain God and express Him.

3. In order for the divine light to shine into man’s inward parts, God’s Spirit
as the oil must soak (mingle with) man’s spirit as the wick and “burn”
together with man’s spirit—Rom. 8:16; 12:11.

4. If we respond to the spirit’s shining, we will walk according to the
spirit—8:4.

B. The Spirit of God is also a lamp, with a sevenfold intensity to His
shining—Rev. 4:5:
1. Our regenerated spirit is a lamp indwelt by the Spirit of God, who is also
a lamp.
2. Man’s spirit and God’s spirit are both lamps, together enlightening the
inward parts—Prov. 20:27; Rev. 4:5.
3. The spirit wants to enlighten every part of our soul.

C. When we exercise our spirit to pray properly, there is a lamp
shining—Eph. 6:18; 1:17-18; 5:8-9:

1. As we pray, our spirit functions as a shining lamp, searching all the parts
of our soul—Prov. 20:27.

2. The more we exercise our spirit in prayer, the more we are enlightened—2
Cor. 4:6:
a. The lamp may shine on our thoughts, emotions, and will.

b. Our inward parts will be thoroughly searched by the Lord—Psa. 139:23-24.

3. After such a time of prayer, we will feel bright and transparent, filled with
God—Eph. 5:8-9.

§Day 4

肆 “你要切切保守你心，因为生命的果效发 IV. “Keep your heart with all vigilance, / For from it are the

之于心”—箴四 23：
一 魂是人位的本身，而心是采取行动的人位—路一
66，二 19，51，徒十一 23，弗三 17，帖前三 13：
1 我们里面的所是里有个代表我们的，就是我们的
心—路六 45，约十六 22，林后三 16。
2 我们与神的关系首先是在于心，因为心是我们表达
自己的器官，也是我们借以决定接受或拒绝事物的
器官—徒八 37，罗十 9 ～ 10。
3 我们的灵虽是纯净的，但灵所发表出来的乃在于我
们的心—帖后二 17，三 5。

二 心是我们全人的出入口—太十三 19，十五 18 ～
19：
1 我们真实的人乃是借着我们的心而出来，因为我们
这人的交通是通过我们的心—路六 45。
2 我们的灵是我们这人的源头，但我们的心是通道，
是出入口，我们这人里面的交通是从这里通过—太
十二 34 ～ 35。
3 要作正确的基督徒，我们需要运用我们的灵，也需
要切切保守我们的心，以护卫这心—箴四 23。

【周五】
三 箴言四章二十三节里“保守”的原文，意思是
“护卫”：
1 我们应当护卫我们的心，胜过护卫一切，因为生命
的果效发之于心。
2 二十三节里的“果效”，含示源头、泉源和流出：
a 生命的果效是生命的流出—参约四 14。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 10 周纲要 - 第 5 页

issues of life”—Prov. 4:23:

A. The soul is the person himself, but the heart is the person in action—
Luke 1:66; 2:19, 51; Acts 11:23; Eph. 3:17; 1 Thes. 3:13:

1. We have something in our inner being that represents us, and this
representative is our heart—Luke 6:45; John 16:22; 2 Cor. 3:16.
2. The relationship that we have with God first depends on our heart, because
the heart is the organ by which we express ourselves and by which we
make decisions to receive or reject things—Acts 8:37; Rom. 10:9-10.

3. Although our spirit is pure, what is expressed from our spirit depends on
our heart—2 Thes. 2:17; 3:5.

B. The heart is the entrance and exit to our whole being—Matt. 13:19;
15:18-19:
1. It is through our heart that our real being comes out because the traffic of
our being is through our heart—Luke 6:45.

2. Our spirit is the source of our being, but our heart is the passage, the
entrance and the exit, through which the traffic in our being passes—
Matt. 12:34-35.

3. In order to be a proper Christian, we need to exercise our spirit and
guard our heart by keeping it with all vigilance—Prov. 4:23.

§Day 5

C. The Hebrew word rendered “keep” in Proverbs 4:23 means “guard”:

1. We should guard our heart above all because out of it are the issues of
life.
2. Issues in Proverbs 4:23 implies sources and springs as well as issues:
a. The issues of life are the flowing out of life—cf. John 4:14.

2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 10 - Page 5

b 心与生命的源头、生命的泉源、以及生命的流出都
有关联—参赛十二 3。
c 我们的所是，我们真实之人的泉源，源头，从我们
的心流出—参约七 37 ～ 38。

四 我们借着照顾我们的心，并在主面前以生命的
路彻底对付我们的心，而护卫我们的心；我们
越对付我们的心，就越护卫我们的心—诗二六
2，一三九 23 ～ 24，箴四 23，罗八 27，启二
23，太十三 18 ～ 23，五 8。
五 我们要为着神的建造而在生命里长大，就必须爱
主，留意我们的灵，切切护卫我们的心，而留在
生命的途径上—彼前一 8，二 2，5，三 4，15，
箴二一 2，四 18 ～ 23，申十 12，可十二 30。

【周六】
伍 “爱能遮掩一切过错”—箴十 12 下：
一 “遮掩人过的，是寻求爱；重提旧事的，离间
密友”—十七 9。
二 遮盖是爱；揭露是没有爱—雅五 20。
三 遮盖带进祝福，揭露带进咒诅—创九 22 ～ 27：
1 揭露别人的人遭受咒诅。
2 遮盖别人的罪、缺点和短处的人，享受、得着并接
受祝福。

四 爱是“凡事包容”，（林前十三 7 上，）意即
遮盖一切，不仅遮盖好事，也遮盖坏事：
1 “作长老的必须知道，他们在牧养时，必须遮盖别
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 10 周纲要 - 第 6 页

b. The heart is related to the sources of life, the springs of life, and the issues of
life—cf. Isa. 12:3.
c. The fountain, the source, of what we are, of our real being, flows out from our
heart—cf. John 7:37-38.

D. We guard our heart by caring for our heart and having a thorough
dealing with our heart before the Lord in the way of life; the more we
deal with our heart, the more we guard our heart—Psa. 26:2; 139:2324; Prov. 4:23; Rom. 8:27; Rev. 2:23; Matt. 13:18-23; 5:8.
E. In order to grow in life for God’s building, we need to love the Lord,
take heed to our spirit, and guard our heart with all vigilance to stay
on the pathway of life—1 Pet. 1:8; 2:2, 5; 3:4, 15; Prov. 21:2; 4:18-23;
Deut. 10:12; Mark 12:30.

§Day 6

V. “Love covers all transgressions”—Prov. 10:12b:

A. “He who covers a transgression seeks love, / But he who repeats a
matter separates close friends”—17:9.
B. To cover is love; to uncover is not love—James 5:20.

C. Covering brings in blessing, but uncovering brings in a curse—Gen.
9:22-27:
1. Those who uncover others suffer the curse.

2. Those who cover others’ sins, defects, and shortcomings enjoy gain and
receive blessing.

D. “Love covers all things” (1 Cor. 13:7a), not only the good things but
also the bad things:

1. “The elders need to realize that in their shepherding, they have to cover

人的罪，不可计算别人的恶”—活力排，八九页：
a “凡揭露召会中肢体的缺点、短处和罪恶的，就没
有资格作长老”—九○页。
b “我们若揭露在我们长老职分下，在我们牧养之下
的肢体，这就废除了我们的资格”—九○页。
2 我们需要按着神牧养人，有遮掩一切过错的爱—彼
前五 2，箴十 12 下。

五 “最要紧的，是彼此热切相爱，因为爱能遮盖
众多的罪”—彼前四 8。

others’ sins, to not take account of others’ evils”—The Vital Groups, p. 72:

a. “Whoever uncovers the defects, shortcomings, and sins of the members of the
church is disqualified from the eldership”—p. 72.
b. “Our uncovering of the members under our eldership, our shepherding,
annuls our qualification”—p. 72.

2. We need to shepherd others according to God, with a love that covers all
transgressions—1 Pet. 5:2; Prov. 10:12b.

E. “Above all, have fervent love among yourselves, because love covers a
multitude of sins”—1 Pet. 4:8.

WEEK 10 — DAY 1

晨兴喂养

Morning Nourishment

箴二九 18“没有异象，民就放肆…。”

Prov. 29:18 Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint…

徒二六 19“亚基帕王啊，我故此没有违背那从天
上来的异象。”

Acts 26:19 Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly
vision.

箴言二十九章十八节说，“没有异象，民就放
肆。”这意思是说，如果没有异象，百姓就会放肆，
如同脱缰的野马发起野性。在新约里提起异象一辞，
最明显的就是保罗。行传二十六章，保罗在亚基帕
王面前申辩时，就在十九节冒出一句话说，“我故
此没有违背那从天上来的异象。”保罗从前在犹太
教事奉神，凭借的乃是遗传，不是异象。但自从他
在往大马色路上遇见主、蒙召、被选定开始，他就
成了一个有异象的人。从那时起，他的事奉就受那
异象支配。（李常受文集一九八六年第二册，六至
七页。）

Proverbs 29:18 says, “Where there is no vision, the people cast off
restraint.” This means that without a vision, the people will become loose,
like wild horses in their untamed state. The clearest instance in the New
Testament where the word vision is mentioned is in the case of Paul. In
Acts 26:19, while he was defending himself before King Agrippa, he uttered
this word: “I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.” When Paul was
serving God in the Jewish religion, he was serving by tradition, not by vision,
but from the day the Lord met him, called him, and chose him on the way
to Damascus, he became a man with a vision. From that time onward, his
service was governed by that vision. (CWWL, 1986, vol. 2, “Crucial Words of
Leading in the Lord’s Recovery, Book 1: The Vision and Definite Steps for the
Practice of the New Way,” pp. 4-5)

When the divine light shines over the divine revelation, the divine revelation
becomes the divine vision (Acts 26:19). A vision is a view whereby we may see
something. If a person’s eyes are covered by a thick veil, there may be some
wonderful scenery in front of him, but he is not able to see it. He cannot see
because he has no vision, but when the veil is taken away, he can see.

Many Christians read the Bible with a veil. This is why Paul says that we
should look unto Christ with an unveiled face (2 Cor. 3:18)…. Paul says that
when the sons of Israel read the books of Moses, they have a veil upon them
and see nothing (vv. 13-15). Paul then says that whenever their heart turns
to the Lord, the veil is taken away and that wherever the Spirit is, there is

We need to learn to come to the Bible every day by coming to God.
We should confess our sins to make a clear situation so that we can have
fellowship with God in the Spirit. Then we should read His Word by prayreading. Every day we will receive revelation; the Spirit will also shine over
the revelation, and we will receive a vision. There is a progression from the
Word to revelation and from revelation to vision.

In Ephesians 1:17 Paul asked the Lord to grant us a spirit of wisdom and
revelation. When the Spirit shines over the revelation, the vision is here.
Without the light we cannot receive the vision, even if the veil is taken away.
The veil should be gone, and the light should come. Furthermore, we need
the sight. If we are blind, we will not be able to see anything, even if the veil
is removed and the light is here. We need the revelation, the light, the vision
through the light, and the sight. Then the veil is gone, the vision is here, and
we have the light with the sight. We also have the understanding of the vision
through the Spirit’s wisdom.
We are one with the Lord in our spirit, so we must review the divine
revelation in our spirit with the Lord. Then the light shines to bring us the
vision. Otherwise, at most we can have only revelation but no vision. After
we review the divine revelation again and again in our spirit with the Lord
Himself, more light comes, and the vision is here for us to see.

Paul prayed in Ephesians 1:18 that the eyes of our heart would be
enlightened that we might see. We need not only the light but also the sight….
We need the revelation plus the light plus the sight. The light comes from
God; the sight is within us. The revelation plus the divine light with our sight
brings us the vision. (CWWL, 1994-1997, vol. 3, “The Triune God’s Revelation
and His Move,” pp. 68-69, 85-86)

（倪柝声文集第二辑第十七册，三二○至三二一页。）

Truth is something that we have to buy; it is something that has a price.
If we want to please the Lord and stand for the truth, we have to pay the
price. If we are clear about the truth, we have to obey it all the way. Many
Christians cannot pay the price because they want to please men; they try
to dodge the truth….Truth is like a pillar in a house. A pillar is not like a
window or a door, which can be enlarged or reduced at will. A pillar cannot
be moved; it cannot be made higher or lower, and it cannot be tilted. In
other words, truth can never be changed. If we cannot pay the price to
obey any part of the truth, we can only condemn ourselves and confess
our weakness; we cannot lower the standard of the truth just because we
cannot make it or because it creates dire consequences for us. (CWWN, vol.
37, p. 254)

truth is compromised by their friends, immediate family, or relatives….
If the truth is the truth, it should not be compromised, whether by our
own brothers, our relatives, or our intimate friends…. [For example],
in a certain place a controversy arises. A number of the saints may be
favorably disposed toward a particular group of brothers and side with
them, whereas a number of others may have a preference for another
group of people and line up on their side. Instead of sitting down and
counting the cost of being absolute for the truth and of following the truth,
they are influenced and directed by their own emotions. This does not
mean that the brothers are not speaking about the truth….They have not
brushed the truth completely aside; they still have some care for the truth.
But they are not absolute to the truth. Being absolute to the truth means
that no personal feelings or family relationships are allowed to stand in
the way of the truth. In spiritual matters, the truth is compromised as
soon as human relationships are taken into account. As soon as human
relationships become involved, God’s word and His commandments are
discounted through human factors, and the truth is compromised.

The Bible contains many ordinances and commandments. These
ordinances and commandments are from God, and God’s servants need to
preach and announce them….We cannot be a servant of God if we cannot
preach beyond what we can practice. This is because the truth is absolute. The
standard of the divine Word must not be lowered to the level of our personal
attainment. We cannot tamper with the truth in any way in order to justify
our own deficiencies….We have to transcend ourselves, our own feelings, and
our own personal interest in our speaking. This is a high requirement for the
servants of the Lord. We must beware of doing things one way as they affect
other brothers and sisters but doing them another way as they are applied to
our spouse or our children…. If God’s Word says something, it is so, no matter
who is involved….We have to learn to uphold the absoluteness of the truth.

There are some people who live according to the flesh. Their only concern is
the pleasure of the moment. Others live according to their soul. They are elated
when things go well for them but depressed when their circumstances are not
favorable. Sometimes they are pleasant toward their associates, but other times
they are critical or even hateful. There are others who also live according to
their soul but are highly regarded by those who know them. Rather than being
changeable like the weather, they act rationally and think ahead as to what
course of action they will take. Their behavior is controlled by their thoughts.

These three kinds of people include almost everyone. There are very few
who live according to the spirit. You were in one of these three categories until
one day when you heard the gospel. The Spirit of God touched your conscience,
which is part of the spirit. Your spirit was activated, leading you to repent and
confess your sins. Your spirit is now a lamp indwelt by the Spirit of God, who is
also a lamp. The spirit wants to enlighten every part of your soul. By responding
to the spirit’s shining, you will be walking “according to the spirit” (Rom. 8:4).

Sometimes when God wants to shine in us, we will not open to Him. This
is why, after we have been praying for a while, we sometimes have nothing
more to say. When we use our spirit to pray, it functions as a shining lamp,
searching all the parts of our soul. It may shine on our thoughts, but we
refuse to have the Lord probe there….The spirit may shine on our emotions,
especially the sisters’, but we close up, sometimes even weeping, begging
the Lord not to touch that area. The same thing may happen with our will,
especially the brothers’; if we close our will, the spirit cannot fulfill its
function of shining.

When we pray properly, using our spirit, there is a lamp shining. If we
sense it shining on our thoughts, we can say, “Lord, I open my mind to
You. Shine in me. Expose my thoughts.” In His light we confess our sins.
When He shines on our emotions, we can open and confess what He
reveals to be wrong. Then He will shine on our will, and we can open this
room also to Him. As we open all these chambers one by one, the spirit
will shine, and we will confess our sins….The more we [keep praying],
the more we are enlightened. Our inward parts will all be thoroughly
searched by the Lord. After such a time of prayer, we will feel bright and
transparent, filled with God. This is one aspect of the lamp—our spirit
shining within.

The other aspect is that of the seven Spirits. The Spirit of God today is the
seven lamps shining on us in an intensified way. Many of us have experienced
this intensified shining, far stronger than a simple prick of the conscience,
condemning a wrong thought or wrong motive. What did not bother us in
the past we can no longer do. If we open our mouth to tell a joke, the seven
Spirits shine, and our sentence is cut off in midair. If we begin to make some
critical comments about a certain sister, the seven Spirits shine, and our
words fail. Even when we are off just a little, the Spirit is there as the light
shining. (CWWL, 1979, vol. 1, “Life Messages, Volume 2,” pp. 424-425)

The relationship that we have with God first depends on the heart,
because the heart is the very organ by which we express ourselves and by
which we make decisions to receive or reject things….The main entrance
of a building is its guard, controlling what should remain outside and what
should come in. In the same way, our heart is our guard. It is the entrance
into ourselves. Whatever goes out or comes in does so through our heart.
There is at least one verse in the Scriptures that tells us this. Proverbs
4:23 says, “Keep your heart with all vigilance, / For from it are the issues
of life.” This can also be translated “Guard your heart.” The issues of life
are the flowing out of life. By this verse we can realize that the heart is
the entrance, the guard, of our whole being. We believe in the Lord Jesus,
but by what organ do we believe? It is by the heart (Rom. 10:10), because
the heart is the organ that we use to make a decision, to reject or receive
something. (CWWL, 1964, vol. 4, “Practical Lessons on the Experience of

We have the fellowship of life, the sense of life, and the law of life within,
and we have the anointing of the Triune God within us. However, this
requires our cooperation, and our cooperation depends first on the heart. We
speak much about the exercise of the spirit. This is good, but before we learn
how to exercise our spirit, we must learn how to deal with our heart—to be
renewed in our mind, to have a loving emotion, to be right in our conscience,
and to have a soft will.
If we deal with our mind, emotion, conscience, and will, we will have a
proper heart, and it will be a useful entrance for God. We will have a good
dealing with the Lord, and we will allow Him to have the ground and the
way to deal with us in a proper way. Then we will have the Triune God
within us as life and the anointing. This requires our cooperation…. Put all
this into practice. Practice to be clear in your mind, love the Lord with your
emotion, have a right conscience, and be softened in your will. The only
way to do this is by praying. We need to go to the Lord to pray, “Lord, give
me a clear mind, an understanding heart.” The prayer in Song of Songs 1:4,
“Draw me; we will run after you,” is a prayer for a loving heart. We also have
to pray, “Lord, give me a loving heart toward You and emotions that love
only You.” We also must pray for this, and also pray for our conscience to be
right. Then when we pray, we will see that our will is not only hardened but
stubborn, so we need to pray for our will to be softened. What does it mean
for a person to have a pure heart? It is these four matters—the mind is clear,
the emotion is loving, the conscience is right, and the will is soft. This kind
of heart is a pure and right heart. It is a proper heart. We all need to deal
with our heart in this way. We need such a heart, so we must pray for this.

申十 12“以色列啊，现在耶和华你神向你所要的
是什么？只要你敬畏耶和华你的神，行祂一切
的道路，全心全魂爱祂并事奉祂。”

Deut. 10:12 And now, O Israel, what does Jehovah your God ask of you
except that you fear Jehovah your God so that you would walk in all His
ways and love Him and serve Jehovah your God with all your heart and
with all your soul.

帖前三 13“好使你们的心，当我们主耶稣同祂众
圣徒来临的时候，在我们的神与父面前，得以
坚固，在圣别上无可指摘。”

1 Thes. 3:13 So that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness
before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His
saints.

因为心是我们的代表，所以所罗门在箴言四章
二十三节说，“你要切切保守你心，因为生命的果
效发之于心。”…保守的原文意思是护卫。我们应
当护卫我们的心，胜过护卫一切，因为生命的果效
发之于心。…心与生命的源头、生命的泉源、以及
生命的流出都有关联。我们首先有源头，其次有泉
源，然后有流出。

Because the heart is our representative, Solomon says in Proverbs 4:23,
“Keep your heart with all vigilance; for from it are the issues of life.”…The
Hebrew word rendered “keep” means guard. We should guard our heart
above all because out of it are the issues of life….The heart is related to the
sources of life, the springs of life, and the issues of life. First we have the
source, then the spring, and then the issue.

我们日常生活所有的果效都是由心发出的。…电
的流通怎样依赖开关；照样，我们的日常生活也依
赖我们的心向什么东西打开，向什么东西关闭。我
们的心是我们这个人的生命，我们日常生活和我们
全人的开关。箴言四章二十三节的“生命”，含示
生机的元素—生命的元素，也含示我们日常的生活
行动，事实上就是我们整个人的生活。因此，这节
经文里的“生命”是包罗一切的。我们人类都有人
的一生，这人生有生机的元素，也有日常的生活。
这生命的开关就是心。（帖撒罗尼迦前书生命读经，
二一七至二一八页。）

Out of the heart come all the issues of our daily life. As human beings,
we have life, and this life acts through our heart…. As the flow of electricity
depends on the switch, so our daily living is dependent on what our heart
switches on and off. Our heart is the switch of our human life, of our daily life,
of our being. The word life in Proverbs 4:23 implies an organic element, the
element of life; it also implies our daily living and activities, in fact, our entire
human life. Hence, the word life in this verse is inclusive. As human beings,
we have a human life, and this human life has an organic element and also a
daily living. The switch of this life is the heart. (Life-study of 1 Thessalonians,
p. 182)

Suppose as a brother is studying the Bible he is disturbed by the barking
of a dog…. As he is reading the Bible and is disturbed by the dog’s barking,
something within this brother’s heart motivates him to shout at the dog. This
shouting is an issue that springs out from the source of the heart. This is an
illustration of the heart as the acting representative of our entire being. The
activities and movements of our physical body depend on our physical heart.
In like manner, our daily living depends on our psychological heart. The way
we act and behave depends on the kind of heart we have.
To be a living believer involves both our spirit and our heart. Doctrinally,
we may say that we can become living by exercising our spirit. But in practice
often it seems that the exercise of our spirit does not work….The reason the
exercise of the spirit may not work is that the heart does not act. This means
that there is something wrong in the heart. Perhaps the mind is not renewed,
sanctified, transformed; it may not be saturated with the Lord and occupied
by Him. Instead, it may be filled with worldly things. We may exercise our
spirit and say, “Praise the Lord!” However, this exercise may not work to
make us living. The exercise of the spirit works only when our heart is active.

If our heart is dormant or asleep, exercising our spirit to call on the name
of the Lord will not be effective. This exercise cannot work if our acting agent,
our heart, is dormant. This is the reason we need to deal thoroughly with our
heart. This dealing must include our mind, emotion, and will. Our mind must
be the mind of Christ, our emotion must be saturated with the love of Christ,
and our will must be one with His will. If this is the condition of our heart,
our heart will be active and functioning. Then if we call on the Lord when our
heart is active, this calling will be very effective. We need to pray, “Lord, have
mercy on me. I want to have my mind renewed. I want to have my emotion
filled with Your love. I want to have a will that is truly one with Your will.” If
we have such a heart, then the heart as our acting agent will be established
blameless in holiness, blameless in the state of being made holy. (Life-study
of 1 Thessalonians, pp. 182-183, 194-195)

箴十 12“恨能挑启争端；爱能遮掩一切过错。”

Prov. 10:12 Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all transgressions.

十七 9“遮掩人过的，是寻求爱；重提旧事的，
离间密友。”

17:9 He who covers a transgression seeks love, but he who repeats a
matter separates close friends.

彼前四 8“最要紧的，是彼此热切相爱，因为爱
能遮盖众多的罪。”

1 Pet. 4:8 Above all, have fervent love among yourselves, because love
covers a multitude of sins.

爱…是不轻易发怒。因着缺少爱，人很容易发怒。
我们若充满了神圣的爱，无论我们多么受到斥责，
我们也不会发怒。爱是不计算人的恶。我们必须承
认，我们常计算别人的恶。有些妻子有一本记录，
一本账簿，记下她们丈夫的失败和缺点。这个记录
不一定是写下来的，却是在她们的头脑里。

Love is not provoked. People are easily provoked because of the shortage
of love. Regardless of how much we are rebuked, we will not be provoked if
we are filled with the divine love. Love does not take account of evil. We have
to confess that we have taken account of other people’s evil. Some wives have
a record, an account, of their husband’s failures and defects. This record may
not be written, but it is in their mind.

作长老的必须知道，他们在牧养时，必须遮盖别
人的罪，不可计算别人的恶。爱是凡事包容，〔林前
十三 7，〕意即遮盖一切，不仅遮盖好事，也遮盖坏事。
凡揭露召会中肢体的缺点、短处和罪恶的，就没有资
格作长老。我们若揭露在我们长老职分下，在我们牧
养之下的肢体，这就废除了我们的资格。爱也是凡事
忍耐，永不败落。林前十三章总结地说，“如今常存
的，有信、望、爱这三样，其中最大的是爱。”（13。）
根据我多年的观察，大多数同工的灵都是“能
力”的灵，而不是爱的灵。我们需要爱的灵，好征
服今日召会的堕落。我们不该说什么或作什么去威
吓人。反之，我们说话或行事，都该一直凭着已经
如火挑旺起来的爱的灵。（活力排，八九至九○、
九二页。）

The elders need to realize that in their shepherding, they have to cover
others’ sins, to not take account of others’ evils. Love covers all things [1 Cor.
13:7], not only the good things but also the bad things. Whoever uncovers the
defects, shortcomings, and sins of the members of the church is disqualified
from the eldership. Our uncovering of the members under our eldership, our
shepherding, annuls our qualification. Love also endures all things and never
falls away. First Corinthians 13 concludes by saying, “Now there abide faith,
hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love” (v. 13).

According to my observation throughout the years, most of the coworkers have a human spirit of “power” but not of love. We need a spirit of
love to conquer the degradation of today’s church. We should not say or do
anything to threaten people. Instead, we should always say and do things
with a spirit of love, which has been fanned into flame. (CWWL, 1994-1997,
vol. 5, “The Vital Groups,” pp. 123-125)

我们若彼此相恨，就会有无止境的争端；但是爱
能遮掩，不仅遮掩一个罪，一些罪，乃是遮掩一切
的罪。〔箴十 12。〕雅各在他的著作末了说，“我
的弟兄们，…那叫一个罪人从他错谬的路上转回的，
必救他的魂脱离死亡，也必遮盖众多的罪。”（雅
五 19 ～ 20。）若有人达不到标准，受迷惑离开真理，
我们该恨他，还是爱他？我们可能不爱那些无法过
团体生活的人，而只爱在我们的弟兄姊妹之家过正
确生活的特别一班人。这完全不是照着圣经中所启
示主的灵。一位弟兄若是表现良好，就不太需要我
们的爱，因为他已经得到充分的爱了。几乎人人都
爱好人，那受迷惑离开真理的人怎么办？若是有一
位弟兄受迷惑离开真理，到公会聚会，或是去看电
影，我们的小排可能觉得我们不需要他，并且不接
纳他，因为他不合格。这不是爱，乃是恨。爱能遮
盖众多的罪。即使我们知道他去看电影，也不该告
诉别人；这就是遮盖他。我们不喜欢揭露他或暴露
他。揭露不是爱。恨能挑启争端；爱能遮盖众多的
罪。我们宁可象挪亚的两个儿子，遮盖父亲因醉酒
而有的赤身。我们不喜欢揭露别人。遮盖带进祝福，
揭露带进咒诅。这不是一件小事。揭露别人的人遭
咒诅，而遮盖别人的罪、缺点和短处的人，享受、
得着并接受祝福。雅各书五章二十节的“遮盖众多
的罪”，是雅各用旧约的说法，来指明使一个犯错
的弟兄回转，就是遮盖他的罪，使他不被定罪。这
里的“遮盖…罪”，等于十五节的“罪…蒙赦免”，
正如诗篇三十二篇一节所说的：“得赦免其过，遮
盖其罪的，这人是有福的。”（对同工长老们以及
爱主寻求主者爱心的话，一八至一九页。）

If we hate each other, we will have endless strife, but love covers not
only one sin or some sins but all sins [Prov. 10:12]. James ends his writing
by saying, “My brothers,… he who turns a sinner back from the error of his
way will save that one’s soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins”
(James 5:19-20). Should we hate one who is not up to the standard, who is
led astray from the truth, or should we love him? We may not love those who
are not able to live in corporate living. We may love only the particular group
of those who live properly in our homes. This is altogether not according
to the Spirit of the Lord as revealed in the Bible. If a brother is good, he
does not need our love very much, because he has already been sufficiently
loved. Nearly everyone loves a good person, but what about one who is led
astray from the truth? If a brother is led astray from the truth to attend the
denominations or go to the movies, our small group may feel that we do not
need him, and we do not accept him because he is not qualified. This is not
love; this is hate. Love covers many sins. Even if we know that he goes to
the movies, we should not tell others. This is to cover him. We do not like to
uncover him or expose him. To uncover is not love. Hatred stirs up strife, but
love covers all sins. We would rather be like the sons of Noah who covered
their father’s nakedness, which was due to his drunkenness. We do not like
to uncover others. Covering brings in blessing, but uncovering brings in a
curse. This is not a small matter. Those who uncover suffer the curse, but
those who cover others’ sins, defects, and shortcomings enjoy, gain, and
receive blessing. Cover a multitude of sins in James 5:20 is an Old Testament
expression used by James to indicate that turning an erring brother back is
to cover his sins so that he is not condemned. Cover…sins here equals sins…
forgiven in verse 15, as in Psalm 32:1, which says, “Blessed is he whose
transgression is forgiven; / Whose sin is covered.” (CWWL, 1994-1997, vol. 5,
“A Word of Love to the Co-workers, Elders, Lovers, and Seekers of the Lord,”
pp. 15-16)

壹 过正确为人生活的第一个原则是敬畏主， I. The first principle for man to live a proper human life is for
him to fear the Lord, to revere the Lord; to fear the Lord is to
尊崇主；敬畏主就是怕得罪主，怕失去祂

一 敬畏主就是在每件事上顾到并尊重祂，绝不忘
记祂是创造我们的奇妙之神；（赛四三 7；）敬
畏主会使我们停止作恶；敬畏主也会使我们感
受别人的苦难，并向他们施怜悯，施怜恤。
二 敬畏主，不只是远离罪，并且更进一步，乃是
拒绝自己；敬畏主不是仅仅怕我们犯罪或属世，
乃是怕我们所作的是出于自己，不是出于主—

A. To fear the Lord is to consider and regard Him in everything, never
forgetting that He is the wonderful God who has created us (Isa.
43:7); fearing the Lord stops us from doing evil; it also causes us
to be touched by the sufferings of others and to show mercy and
compassion to them.
B. To fear the Lord is not only fleeing from sins but also, and even more,
rejecting the self; fearing the Lord is not merely to fear that we have
sinned or that we are worldly but to fear that what we are doing is out

三 敬畏神是知识和智慧的开端；认识至圣者便是聪明；
知识、智慧和聪明都是从神而来；我们若敬畏祂，
尊崇祂，这些就会成为我们的产业—箴一 1，7，
二 4 ～ 5，三 5 ～ 10，八 13，九 10，十 27，十四 2，
26 ～ 27，十五 16，33 上，十六 6，十九 23。

of ourselves, not out of the Lord—Matt. 16:24; 2 Cor. 4:5.

C. The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the
Holy One is understanding; knowledge, wisdom, and understanding
come from God; if we fear Him, revere Him, these will be our
possessions—Prov. 1:1, 7; 2:4-5; 3:5-10; 8:13; 9:10; 10:27; 14:2, 2627; 15:16, 33a; 16:6; 19:23.

贰 以赛亚预言耶和华的灵—智慧的灵、聪明 II. Isaiah prophesied that the Spirit of Jehovah—the Spirit of
wisdom, the Spirit of understanding, the Spirit of counsel, the
的灵、谋略的灵、能力的灵、知识的灵、
Spirit of might, the Spirit of knowledge, and the Spirit of the
以及敬畏耶和华的灵—必安歇在基督身
fear of Jehovah—would rest upon Christ—Isa. 11:1-2:
上—赛十一 1 ～ 2：
一 那灵一直与主耶稣同在，与祂是一；祂凭那灵行动，
过一种在那灵里、同着那灵、借着那灵、并经过那
灵的生活；以赛亚十一章二节给我们看见，在主的
人性生活里，那灵带着上述的一切属性得以显出—
路四 1，14，十 21，约一 32，太十二 28。
二 耶稣在祂的人性生活里被尊崇、顺从而畏惧神
的灵所充满；祂也以敬畏耶和华为乐；在祂的
复活里祂现今是耶稣基督包罗万有、全备供应
的灵，作为敬畏耶和华的灵，这灵包含主耶稣
难以描述的人性生活与职事—赛十一 2 ～ 3，腓
一 19：
1 从来没有一个人象耶稣那样敬畏神；主耶稣告诉我们，
在执行神新约的职事上，祂从来不从自己作什么，（约
五 19，）祂不作自己的工，（四 34，十七 4，）祂不说
自己的话，（十四 10，24，）祂不凭着自己的意思作什
么，（五 30，）祂也不寻求自己的荣耀。（七 18。）
2 耶稣在生活中总是在神里面，同着神并为着神行事；
神是在祂的生活中，并且祂与神是一；这就是那在耶

A. The Spirit was with the Lord Jesus all the time and was one with Him;
He walked by the Spirit and lived a life in, with, by, and through the
Spirit; Isaiah 11:2 shows that in the Lord’s human living the Spirit was
manifested with all the above attributes—Luke 4:1, 14; 10:21; John
1:32; Matt. 12:28.

B. In His human living, Jesus was filled with the Spirit of the reverential,
obedient fear of the Lord; He also delighted in the fear of the Lord;
in His resurrection He is now the all-inclusive, bountifully supplying
Spirit of Jesus Christ as the Spirit of the fear of Jehovah, who includes
the indescribable human living and ministry of the Lord Jesus—Isa.
11:2-3; Phil. 1:19:

1. No human being ever feared God as much as Jesus did; in carrying out
God’s New Testament ministry, the Lord Jesus told us that He never did
anything out of Himself (John 5:19), He did not have His own work (4:34;
17:4), He did not speak His own word (14:10, 24), He did everything not
by His own will (5:30), and He did not seek His own glory (7:18).
2. Jesus lived a life in which He did everything in God, with God, and for
God; God was in His living, and He was one with God; this is the reality

稣身上是实际者；（弗四 20 ～ 21；）我们需要求主
这实际的灵，引导我们进入对祂服从的生命和顺从父
的生命之经历的实际。（约十六 13，腓二 5 ～ 11。）
3 一天过一天我们需要向父全然且绝对地敞开，求祂
以复活的基督这包罗万有的灵充满我们；这灵也是
那包含主耶稣人性生活与职事之敬畏耶和华的灵—
路十一 5 ～ 13。

【周二】

in Jesus (Eph. 4:20-21); we need to ask the Lord as the Spirit of reality to
guide us into the reality of experiencing His life of submission and His life
of obedience to the Father (John 16:13; Phil. 2:5-11).

3. Day by day we need to completely and absolutely open to the Father and
ask Him to fill us with the resurrected Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit,
which is also the Spirit of the fear of the Lord that includes the human
living and ministry of the Lord Jesus—Luke 11:5-13.

§Day 2

叁 敬畏神就是信靠祂—箴三 5 ～ 8，26，十六 III. To fear God is to trust in Him—Prov. 3:5-8, 26; 16:1, 9, 20,
33; 19:21; 30:5-6:
1，9，20，33，十九 21，三十 5 ～ 6：
一 箴言三章五至八节嘱咐我们，要全心信靠耶和
华，不可倚靠自己的聪明；在我们一切的道路
上，都要认定祂，祂必修直我们的途径；不要
自以为有智慧；要敬畏耶和华，远离恶事；这
便医治我们的身体，滋润我们的骨头。
二 “信靠耶和华，以耶和华为可信靠的，那人有
福了。他必象树栽于水旁，沿河边扎根，炎热
来到并不惧怕，叶子仍必青翠，在干旱之年毫
无垩虑，而且结果不止”—耶十七 7 ～ 8：
1 按照神的经纶，信靠神的人象树栽于水旁；这表征
神乃是活水的泉源—二 13。
2 树在河边，借着吸取水的一切丰富而生长；这是
神借着祂的分赐完成祂经纶的一幅图画；我们这
些树要接受神圣的分赐，就必须吸取神这水—参
林前三 6。
3 这位供应之神的丰富，分赐到我们这些树里面，就
以神的神性将我们构成，使我们长成神的度量；（西

A. Proverbs 3:5-8 charges us to trust in the Lord with all our heart
and not rely on our own understanding; in all our ways we should
acknowledge Him, and He will make our paths straight; we should
not be wise in our own eyes; we should fear the Lord and depart from
evil; this will be healing to our body and refreshment to our bones.
B. “Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah / And whose trust Jehovah
is. / And he will be like a tree transplanted beside water, / Which
sends out its roots by a stream, / And will not be afraid when heat
comes; / For its leaves remain flourishing, / And it will not be anxious
in the year of drought / And will not cease to bear fruit”—Jer. 17:7-8:
1. According to God’s economy, the one who trusts in God is like a tree
planted by water, signifying God as the fountain of living waters—2:13.

2. A tree grows beside a river by absorbing all the riches of the water; this
is a picture of God’s economy, which is carried out by His dispensing; in
order to receive the divine dispensing, we as the trees must absorb God
as the water—cf. 1 Cor. 3:6.
3. The riches of the supplying God dispensed into us as the trees constitute
us with God’s divinity and cause us to grow into God’s measure (Col. 2:19);
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 11 - Page 3

二 19；）这样，我们就与神成为一，有同样的元素、
素质、构成和样子。（启四 3，二一 11。）

三 留心训言的必得好处，信靠主的便为有福；（箴
十六 20；）主是我们所信靠的，祂必保守我们
的脚不被缠住。（三 26。）
四 那些爱神的人，凭圣经来到主面前，借此学习
敬畏神；（二 3 ～ 5，约五 39 ～ 40；）我们受
吩咐要紧紧跟随并顺从神的话，作我们敬畏神
的证明。（申六 2。）

【周三】
肆 敬畏主的意思也是尊荣祂：
一 箴言三章九至十节说，我们要以财物，和一切
初熟的出产，尊荣耶和华；这样，我们的仓房
必充满有余，我们的酒醡必盈溢新酒。
二 我们不该是赚得更多的钱，为着将来积存财宝
的人；至少我们出产的十分之一（初熟果子）
必须献给神；我们该一直将神所赐给我们的东
西，慷慨地施与；这是尊荣神—玛二 7 ～ 12，
林后九 6 ～ 8。
三 我们该恳求主使我们专心敬畏祂的名—“耶和华
啊，求你将你的道路指教我；我要行在你的真理
中。求你使我专心敬畏你的名”—诗八六 11。
四 我们需要“洁净自己，除去肉身和灵一切的玷
污，敬畏神，以成全圣别”；这里的敬畏神，
意思是不敢沾不属神或与神无关的事物—林后
七 1，六 17。
五 敬畏基督就是怕得罪作头的基督；这与我们的

in this way we and God become one, having the same element, essence,
constitution, and appearance (Rev. 4:3; 21:11).

C. He who gives heed to the word will find good, and blessed is he who
trusts in the Lord (Prov. 16:20); the Lord will be our confidence, and
He will keep our foot from being caught (3:26).
D. Those who love God learn the fear of God by coming to the Lord in the
Scriptures (2:3-5; John 5:39-40); we are commanded to cleave to and
obey the Word of God as the evidence of our fear of God (Deut. 6:2).

§Day 3

IV. To fear the Lord means that we also honor Him:

A. Proverbs 3:9-10 says that we must honor the Lord with our substance
and with the firstfruits of all our produce; then our barns will be filled
with plenty, and our vats will burst open with new wine.

B. We should not be those who make more money to lay up treasure
for our future; at least one-tenth, the firstfruits, of our produce
must be given to God; we should always be generous in giving of the
things that God has given us; this honors God—Mal. 3:7-12; 2 Cor.
9:6-8.
C. We should beseech the Lord to make our heart single in fearing His
name; “Teach me, O Jehovah, Your way; / I will walk in Your truth. /
Make my heart single in fearing Your name”—Psa. 86:11.
D. We need to “cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of
spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God”; the fear of God here is
not daring to touch things that do not belong to God or are not related
to Him—2 Cor. 7:1; 6:17.
E. To be in the fear of Christ is to fear offending Him as the Head; this

彼此服从有关；我们需要存畏惧事奉主；然后
我们会爱主，好在主里面欢乐并享受主—弗五
18 ～ 21，诗二 11 ～ 12，来十二 28。

【周四】
六 我们都该对神有正确的敬畏，因为我们在基督里
的信徒都要显在基督的审判台前；那时基督要回
来审判祂的信徒，这审判并不是关于他们永远的
救恩，乃是关于他们时代的赏罚—林后五 10，
林前四 4 ～ 5，三 13 ～ 15，罗十四 10。
七 敬畏主是使人延长年日的路；（箴十 27；）神爱、
拯救、保护、祝福、并供应那些敬畏祂的人。（诗
一○三 11，13，17，八五 9，六十 4，箴十四
26 ～ 27，诗一一五 12 ～ 13，三四 9，一一一 5。）
八 敬畏主之人的榜样是挪亚、（来十一 7、）亚伯
拉罕、（创二二 12、）约瑟、（四二 18、）大卫、
（诗二 11 ～ 12，五 7、）尼希米、（尼一 11，
五 9，15、）以及早期的召会。（徒九 31。）

involves our being subject to one another; we need to serve the Lord
with fear; then we will love the Lord in order to rejoice in and enjoy
the Lord—Eph. 5:18-21; Psa. 2:11-12; Heb. 12:28.

§Day 4

F. We all should have a proper fear of God because we believers in Christ
will all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; at that time Christ
will judge His believers at His coming back, not concerning their
eternal salvation but concerning their dispensational reward—2 Cor.
5:10; 1 Cor. 4:4-5; 3:13-15; Rom. 14:10.

G. Fearing the Lord is a way to lengthen life (Prov. 10:27); God loves,
saves, protects, blesses, and provides for those who fear Him (Psa.
103:11, 13, 17; 85:9; 60:4; Prov. 14:26-27; Psa. 115:12-13; 34:9;
111:5).
H.Examples of those who feared the Lord are Noah (Heb. 11:7),
Abraham (Gen. 22:12), Joseph (42:18), David (Psa. 2:11-12; 5:7),
Nehemiah (Neh. 1:11; 5:9, 15), and the early church (Acts 9:31).

伍 对主圣别的敬畏事实上是喜乐的源头，（诗 V. The holy fear of the Lord is actually a source of joy (Psa.
2:11) as a fountain of life (Prov. 14:27) and as a tree of life

源 头 乃 是 神 自 己。（ 箴 三 13，18， 十 一 30，
十三 12，十五 4。）
二 敬畏主引到生命；这是引到生命的狭路（少人
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 晨兴圣言第 11 周纲要 - 第 5 页

A. The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, that one may turn aside from
the snares of death; to fear the Lord, to trust in the Lord, and to take
refuge in the name of the Lord are to walk on the paths of life (2:19;
5:6; 10:17; 14:27; 19:23; Psa. 16:11); the paths of life are the paths
of the tree of life, the source of which is God Himself (Prov. 3:13, 18;
11:30; 13:12; 15:4).
B. The fear of the Lord leads to life; it is the constricted way (the way of
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 11 - Page 5

走的路，不是多人走的路）；生命的途径乃是
使我们活在神里面，而摸着并得着生命；这些
途径就是神摆在我们心里使我们进入祂里面的
大道—箴十九 23，太七 13 ～ 14，诗八四 5。
三 死亡的路就是善恶知识的路，源头是撒但，
表显于我们的己；活在自己里面就是没有神
的同在，行在黑暗的路上，并且没有生命—
箴二 13，三 5 ～ 7，十四 12，十六 25，弗五 2，
8 ～ 9。

【周五】

the few, not of the many) that leads to life; the paths of life are for us
to live in God and thus to touch and obtain life; these paths are the
highways that God has put in our heart for us to enter into Him—
19:23; Matt. 7:13-14; Psa. 84:5.

C. The ways of death are the ways of the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil, the source of which is Satan and which is manifested in our
self; to live in the self is to be without God’s presence, to walk in the
ways of darkness, and to be void of life—Prov. 2:13; 3:5-7; 14:12;
16:25; Eph. 5:2, 8-9.

§Day 5

陆 神应许要赐给我们这些祂的子民一个心和一 VI. God promised to give us, His people, one heart and one way,
to fear Him all the days, for our own good and for the good of
条路，好叫我们终身敬畏祂，使我们和我们
our children after us, and He puts His fear into our hearts, so
以后的子孙得福乐，并且赐我们敬畏祂的心，
that we will not turn away from Him—Jer. 32:39-40:
使我们不转身离开祂—耶三二 39 ～ 40：
一 我们这些蒙神拣选的人，都该有一个心，要爱
神、寻求神、活神、并被神构成，使我们成为
祂的彰显；我们也该有一条路，就是三一神自
己作为内里生命的律连同其神圣的性能—39
节，三一 33 ～ 34，约十四 6 上，罗八 2。

二 这一个心和一条路就是同心合意；（徒一 14，
二 46，四 24，罗十五 6；）人心在基督以外另
有所要，人走基督以外的路，都会导致分裂。
三 神立了永远的约，就是新约；凭着这约，神必
不转身离开我们，并且祂必赐我们敬畏祂的心，
使我们不转身离开祂—耶三二 40。
四 我们敬畏神，就蒙神指示当选择的道路，得知
神亲密的指教和祂的约；唯有敬畏神的人才能
得着神的约的启示，并且祂只将祂亲密的指教

A. We, the chosen people of God, should all have one heart—to love God,
to seek God, to live God, and to be constituted with God that we may
be His expression—and one way—the Triune God Himself as the
inner law of life with its divine capacity—v. 39; 31:33-34; John 14:6a;
Rom. 8:2.
B. This one heart and one way are the one accord (Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24;
Rom. 15:6); divisions result from having a heart for something other
than Christ and taking a way other than Christ.
C. God made an eternal covenant, the new covenant; it is by this
covenant that God will not turn away from us, and He puts His fear
into our hearts, so that we will not turn away from Him—Jer. 32:40.

D. When we fear God, we are instructed by God concerning the way that
we should choose, and we are able to know God’s intimate counsel
and His covenant; only those who fear God can have God’s revelation

赐给那些敬畏祂的人—诗二五 12，14。

of His covenant, and He gives His intimate counsel only to those who
fear Him—Psa. 25:12, 14.

柒 敬畏主和爱主是我们得着赦罪的两个美妙 VII.The fear of the Lord and the love of the Lord are two wonderful
results of the forgiveness of our sins:
结果：
一 神赦罪不会叫人胆大放肆；神赦罪之恩要叫人
敬畏祂；“在你有赦免之恩，要叫人敬畏你”—
一三○ 4。

二 神赦罪之恩也叫我们爱神；路加福音里那个有
罪的女人所以爱主多，乃是因为她得着主的赦
免多—七 39 ～ 50。
三 主越赦免我们，我们就越敬畏祂；我们越敬畏
祂，就越爱祂；在消极一面，我们因着敬畏祂，
就不去作祂所不喜悦的事；在积极一面，我们
因着爱祂，就作祂所喜悦的事。

【周六】

A. God’s forgiveness does not cause man to become audacious and
reckless; the grace of God’s forgiveness brings man into the fear
of the Lord; “With You there is forgiveness, / That You would be
feared”—130:4.
B. The grace of God’s forgiveness also causes us to love God; the reason
the sinful woman in Luke loved the Lord much is that she was
forgiven much by the Lord—7:39-50.

C. The more the Lord forgives us, the more we fear Him; and the more we
fear Him, the more we love Him; on the negative side, because we fear
Him, we refrain from doing things that are displeasing to Him; on the
positive side, because we love Him, we do things that are pleasing to Him.

§Day 6

捌 箴言三十一章向我们陈明敬畏主之人的 VIII. Proverbs 31 presents to us two models of those who fear

if we can be restricted by God and thus deal with ourselves, we will be

构成；结果，他们就在神的管理、神的规律和支配
之下。
b 这样，他们的决断自然会有神在其中，长老们就代
表神治理召会的事务；这种治理乃是神治。

二 箴言三十一章十至三十一节描绘一个才德的妇
人（十二 4，十九 14，得三 11）—她是智慧、
仁慈、勤劳且能干的，能安排、经营并供应她
的 家；“ 她 的 价 值 远 胜 过 珠 宝；”（ 箴 三 一
10；）她的荣耀超越群伦；（29；）这位才德
的妇人预表召会和爱主的圣徒：
1 才德的妇人主要的特点是她敬畏主（恭敬的敬拜、
顺从、服事并信靠主，满了畏惧的尊敬主）；“艳
丽是虚假的，美容是虚浮的；唯敬畏耶和华的妇女，
必得称赞”—30 节。
2 才德妇人的丈夫心里倚靠她；“她一生的日子使丈
夫有益无损；”（12；）“她丈夫在城门口与本地
的长老同坐，为众人所认识。”（23。）
3 这样才德又精明的妇人是从主来的，是她丈夫的冠

4 丈夫该能亲眼看见他妻子“敬畏中纯洁的品行”；

able to reign for God.

2. In ruling over the people, the king first had to be instructed, governed,
ruled, and controlled by the word of God; the principle should be the
same with the elders in the churches—Deut. 17:14-20:

a. In order to administrate, to manage, the church, the elders must be
reconstituted with the holy word of God; as a result, they will be under God’s
government, under God’s rule and control.
b. Then spontaneously, God will be in their decisions, and the elders will
represent God to manage the affairs of the church; this kind of management
is theocracy.

B. Proverbs 31:10 through 31 describes a worthy woman (12:4; 19:14;
Ruth 3:11)—one who is wise, kind, diligent, and capable and who
can arrange, manage, and provide for her household; “Her price is far
above corals” (Prov. 31:10); her glory surpasses all her peers (v. 29);
this worthy woman typifies the church and the saints who love the
Lord:
1. The main characteristic of a worthy woman is that she fears the Lord
(reverently worshipping, obeying, serving, and trusting the Lord with
awe-filled respect); “Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; / But a woman
who fears Jehovah, she will be praised”—v. 30.
2. The heart of the husband of a worthy woman trusts in her; “She does him
good and not evil / All the days of her life” (v. 12); “Her husband is known
in the gates, / When he sits among the elders of the land” (v. 23).

3. Such a worthy and prudent woman is from the Lord as the crown of her
husband (12:4); her children and husband rise up and call her blessed
(31:28); her husband also praises her by saying that she surpasses all
others (v. 29).
4. A husband should be able to see with his own eyes his wife’s “pure

她的妆饰不要重于外面的辫头发、戴金饰、穿衣服，
“乃要重于那以温柔安静的灵为不朽坏之妆饰的心
中隐藏的人，这在神面前是极有价值的”—彼前三
1 ～ 4。
5 在正确的召会生活中，姊妹该“穿着正派合宜，
以廉耻、自守〔自制〕，不以编发、黄金、珍珠、
或贵价的衣服，妆饰自己，乃借着善行，以那适
宜于自称是敬神之女人的为妆饰”；敬神是对神
的尊敬，敬拜神者对神该有的尊崇与恭敬—提前
二 9 ～ 10。
6 老年妇人在举止行动，就是行为上，要恭敬，“好
训练年轻的妇人爱丈夫，爱儿女，清明自守，贞洁，
料理家务，良善，服从自己的丈夫，免得神的话被
毁谤”—多二 3 ～ 5。

三 在得胜方面，我们要象君王；在爱主方面，我
们要象才德的妇人；我们若能如此，在主面前
就有价值和荣耀。

manner of life in fear”; her adorning should not be the outward plaiting
of hair and putting on of gold or clothing with garments, “but the hidden
man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet
spirit, which is very costly in the sight of God”—1 Pet. 3:1-4.

5. In the proper church life the sisters should “adorn themselves in proper
clothing with modesty and sobriety [self-restraint], not with braided hair
and gold or pearls or costly clothing, but, what befits women professing
godly reverence, by good works”; godly reverence is a godly fear toward
God, a revering and honoring of God, as is fitting for one who worships
God—1 Tim. 2:9-10.

6. Older women should be reverent in their behavior, their deportment, so
that “they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their
children, to be of a sober mind, pure, workers at home, good, subject to their
own husbands, that the word of God would not be blasphemed”—Titus 2:3-5.

C. In the aspect of overcoming, we should be like a king; in the aspect
of loving the Lord, we should be like a worthy woman; being like this
will cause us to have value and glory before the Lord.

Isa. 11:2 And the Spirit of Jehovah will rest upon Him, the Spirit of
wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit
of the knowledge and fear of Jehovah.

我们为人的第一个原则，乃是要敬畏主。（箴一
The first principle of human conduct is fearing the Lord (Prov. 1:7, 29; 2:5;
7，29，二 5，三 7，八 13，九 10。）任何事都可作， 3:7; 8:13; 9:10). We may do many things, but we must not offend the Lord.
但必须不得罪主。敬畏主不仅仅是惧怕犯罪或属世， Fearing the Lord is not merely to fear that we have sinned or are worldly but
更是惧怕所作的是出于自己，而不是出于主。
to fear that what we are doing is out of ourselves, not out of the Lord.
箴言中提到神时，几乎都是用“耶和华”这辞，只
有少数几处用“神”这字，因为这位神现今是和人发
生关系的神。在箴言里，这位耶和华乃是人的智慧。
我们不知道如何待人接物，但我们可以倚靠这位神。

Proverbs almost always refers to God as Jehovah—the word God is used in
only a few places—because God today is the God who has a relationship with
man. In Proverbs Jehovah is man’s wisdom. We do not know how to deal with
people and things, but we can depend on God. (CWWL, 1956, vol. 1, p. 501)

The branching out of Jehovah is altogether a matter of the Spirit. Christ
was born of the Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35); that is, He was constituted
of the Spirit as His divine essence….The Spirit was with Him all the time and
was one with Him (Luke 4:1, 14; 10:21; John 1:32; Matt. 12:28). He walked
by the Spirit and lived a life in, with, by, and through the Spirit. (Isa. 11:2,
footnote 1)

who has created us. When we are about to lose our temper, we should revere
God. Revering God stops us from doing evil. Revering God also causes us to be
touched by the sufferings of others and to show mercy and compassion to them.

Even though I was born into Christianity, before I believed in the Lord
Jesus I never revered God. But from the day I got saved, I began to revere
God. In everything I respected and regarded God. That caused a great change
in my life.
To revere God is to fear God. The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of
knowledge and wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding
(Prov. 1:7; 9:10; 15:33a). Knowledge, wisdom, and understanding come
from God. If we fear Him, revering Him, these will be our possession. If we
seek wisdom like silver and search for her like hidden treasures, then we
will understand the fear of Jehovah and find the knowledge of God (2:4-5).
The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil (8:13). The fear of Jehovah prolongs days,
but the years of the wicked will be shortened (10:27). He who walks in his
uprightness fears Jehovah, but he who is perverse in his ways despises Him
(14:2). In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence, and his children will have
a place of refuge. The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, that one may turn
aside from the snares of death (vv. 26-27). Better is a little with the fear of
Jehovah, than great treasure and turmoil with it (15:16). If we are rich in the
fear of Jehovah, we will have peace. (Life-study of Proverbs, pp. 7-8)
Isaiah prophesied that the Spirit of Jehovah—the Spirit of wisdom, the
Spirit of understanding, the Spirit of counsel, the Spirit of might, the Spirit
of knowledge, and the Spirit of the fear of Jehovah—would rest upon Christ
(Isa. 11:2). In the human living of Jesus, the branch of Jesse, people saw the
Spirit of God with all these attributes. He was full of the Spirit of wisdom,
understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah. No
human being has ever feared God as much as Jesus did. (CWWL, 1994-1997,

To revere God is also to trust in Him. Proverbs 3:5-8 charges us to trust in

We should not be wise in our own eyes; we should fear Jehovah and depart

话说，这里有一位活神，需要人敬畏；而这一位神

神特别显出为复活的神，因此新约信徒特别要有敬
虔。…今天我们是新约之下神的子民，因此不仅要
有敬畏，还得有敬虔。这意思是，我们在生活中，
不仅要显出活神，更要显出复活的神。
敬畏就是在你的生活中，没有罪，没有肉体，也
没有世界；敬虔乃是你不仅没有这些，还有神调在你
里面，从你里面显出来。在有的人身上，你可以看
出他是敬畏的。在有的人身上，你可以看出又进一步
了，他是敬虔的。在这人身上不但看不见罪、肉体和
世界，反倒看见另一种奥秘的情形，好象是人，却又
是神。这就是神从人里面显出来了；这就是敬虔。
使徒保罗说，要操练自己以至于敬虔。（提前四 7。）
这意思是告诉我们，在一切的生活上，一面要敬畏，不
敢动肉体，不敢摸罪，不敢有世界；另一面，还要随从
神，而活出神。无论什么时候，神若不动，我就不动；
神动了，我才动。这是一个非常大的功课，需要我们好

picture of God’s economy, which is carried out by His dispensing. In order to
receive the divine dispensing, we as the trees must absorb God as the water
(cf. 1 Cor. 3:6). The riches of the supplying God dispensed into us as the trees
constitute us with God’s divinity and cause us to grow into God’s measure
(Col. 2:19). In this way we and God become one, having the same element,
essence, constitution, and appearance (Rev. 4:3; 21:11). (Jer. 17:8, footnote 1)

We must make a distinction between reverence and godliness. God’s
people in the Old Testament revered Him, but in the New Testament His
people have a godly living. With respect to the living God, man should have
reverence, but with respect to the God of resurrection, man should express
godliness. In the Old Testament God was manifested as the living God; hence,
His people needed to revere Him. In the New Testament God is manifested
as the God of resurrection; hence, the New Testament believers need
godliness…. As God’s New Testament people, we need not only reverence but
also godliness. This means that in our living we should not only express the
living God but also the God of resurrection.
To revere God is to deal with sin, the flesh, and the world in our living. To
be godly is not only to have the absence of sin, the flesh, and the world but to
be mingled with and to express God. Some believers revere God, but others
possess godliness. Such believers do not exhibit sin, the flesh, or the world.
On the contrary, they exhibit something mysterious, something that is both
man and God. This is God being manifested in man. This is godliness.

The apostle Paul says, “Exercise yourself unto godliness” (1 Tim. 4:7). This
means that, on the one hand, we should revere God and not touch sin, the
flesh, or the world. On the other hand, we should follow God and express Him
in our living. If God does not move, neither should we. We should move only
when God moves. This is a great lesson that needs much learning and exercise.

God demands that His children be holy. In 2 Corinthians 7:1, Paul says,
“Therefore since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves
from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of
God.” This verse shows us that our holiness is very much related to our
fear of God. God is holy, and the more we draw near to Him, the more we
feel our uncleanness. The more we serve God, the more we fear ourselves.
When we first learn to fear the Lord, it is natural that we fear the selfelement in everything we do. For example, your son may come and ask
what he should do. If you fear God, you will be afraid of the self-element
in your answer. This is the meaning of fear. Suppose a brother asks you
for help. If you fear God, you will be afraid of yourself in rendering help
to your brother. But at the same time, you will also be afraid of yourself
in refusing to help your brother. You are constantly in fear of yourself….
In your acquaintance with the brothers and sisters, you may constantly
be afraid of any mixture of the self….To fear is to be afraid of the self in
everything that you do. In criticizing or praising others, a person may have
the fear that this criticism or praise comes from the self. Having a fearful

heart is being afraid of the mixture of self-element. (CWWN, vol. 37, p.
163)

To revere God means to fear offending Him. Reverence is an indispensable
attitude that fallen man should possess…. Man is fallen because sin has entered
into man, human nature has become flesh, and the world has been produced.
Sin, the flesh, and the world are incompatible with God. If man is slightly
careless by giving room to sin, the flesh, or the world, he sins against, offends,
opposes, and resists God. Therefore, there is a need for man to revere God.
(CWWL, 1957, vol. 3, “The Living God and the God of Resurrection,” pp. 28-29)

We should fear Christ [Eph. 5:21]….Being in the fear of Christ indicates
that our subjection to one another is in the mood, realm, and atmosphere
of fearing Christ. Here Paul speaks of the fear of Christ for the sake of our
relationships and contact with the people around us….We can only be subject
to one another in the fear of Christ.
Ephesians emphasizes Christ as the Head of the Body. One another in verse
21 refers to the members of the Body. Being subject to one another establishes
a normal relationship among the members under the Head. For example, if the
hand has a problem with the arm, is the hand not subject to the arm or the arm
not subject to the hand? According to our natural concept, the lesser should be
subject to the greater, and thus, the hand should be subject to the arm. But if
the arm does not want the hand, then the arm is not being subject to the hand.
We often have the thought that wives should be subject to their husbands, not
that husbands should be subject to their wives. However, should husbands be
subject to their wives? “Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ” in
verse 21 is the general subject, but only then does Paul speak of wives being
subject to their own husbands. Therefore, not only should wives be subject
to their husbands in the fear of Christ, but husbands should also be subject to
their wives in the fear of Christ. (CWWL, 1953, vol. 2, pp. 467-469)

Each one of us will come under God’s great judgment. Today we may criticize
and judge our brothers, but in that day God will make us explain our words
of criticism and judgment. The Lord said that we will render an account of
every idle word on the day of judgment, for by our words we will be justified
or condemned (Matt. 12:36-37). The day of judgment is awesome. Regardless
of who we are, in that day “we must all be manifested before the judgment

The paths of life are the paths of the tree of life, the source of which is
God Himself; the ways of death are the ways of the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil, the source of which is Satan and which is manifested in our
self. Thus, we must learn to be delivered from the self so as to live in God.
Proverbs teaches us the proper way of human conduct; the secret is to reject
the self to live in God. (CWWL, 1956, vol. 1, p. 514)

我们这些蒙神拣选的人，都该有一个心，要爱神、

我们也该有一条路，就是三一神自己作为内里生命

我们如何能真懂得神的约，真知道神的约呢？诗
篇二十五篇十四节告诉我们说，“耶和华亲密地指
教敬畏祂的人；祂必使他们得知祂的约。”…你可
以听见人说到神的约，你也可以明白一些关于约的
事；但是，如果没有神的启示，你仍旧没有能力，
你仍旧抓不牢神的话。所以我们需要神在我们的灵
里给我们一个指示。
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 - 第 11 周 晨兴圣言 - 第 9 页

We, the chosen people of God, should all have one heart—to love God,
to seek God, to live God, and to be constituted with God that we may be His
expression—and one way—the Triune God Himself as the inner law of life
with its divine capacity (Jer. 31:33-34; John 14:6a). This one heart and one
way are the one accord (Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; Rom. 15:6). Divisions result
from having a heart for something other than Christ and taking a way other
than Christ. (Jer. 32:39, footnote 1)
This eternal covenant is the new covenant (Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 13:20).
It is by this covenant that God will not turn away from us and will plant
us in Christ, our good land…, and Christ in all His aspects will be bought
by us (Jer. 32:40-44), that is, gained by us through our paying the price
to forget the things that are behind and pursue Christ (Phil. 3:8-14). (Jer.
32:40, footnote 1)

Today’s Reading

How can we truly know and understand God’s covenant? Psalm 25:14
tells us: “The intimate counsel of Jehovah is to those who fear Him, / And His
covenant will He make known to them.”…You may hear others speak of God’s
covenant, and you may also know a little about the matter of a covenant, but
unless God reveals it, you will still have no power, and you still cannot hold
fast God’s word. Therefore, God must show it to us in our spirit.

一级卷三，一五○至一五一页。）

What kind of person can have God’s revelation?…The Lord gives His
intimate counsel only to those who fear Him and His covenant to those who
fear Him….To fear means to magnify, to exalt, Him. A person who fears God is
one who seeks God’s will with a full heart, with the intention of completely
submitting to God’s way….Those who are lazy, careless, double-minded,
proud, and complacent can never expect God to reveal His intimate counsel
to them. Neither can they expect God to reveal His covenant to them. The
Lord only gives His intimate counsel and reveals His covenant to those who
fear Him….Therefore, if we truly want to know God’s covenant, we need to
learn to fear God. (The New Covenant, 2nd ed., pp. 37-38)

People think that God’s forgiveness will cause man to become audacious
and reckless. Little do they know that the grace of God’s forgiveness is to
bring man into the fear of God (Psa. 130:4). Our experience tells us that
the more we are forgiven by God, the more we fear Him; the more we have
received the grace of God’s forgiveness, the more we have the fear toward
God. Only those who have never been forgiven by God and who have never
tasted the grace of God’s forgiveness can behave in an audacious and reckless
manner, doing whatever they please. Once we have tasted the grace of God’s
forgiveness, we immediately have a fearful heart and we also hate sin.

The grace of God’s forgiveness causes us not only to fear God but also to love
God. On the negative side, because we fear Him, we refrain from doing things
that are displeasing to God; on the positive side, because we love Him, we do
things that are pleasing to Him…. In Luke 7, the sinful woman, having been
forgiven by the Lord, not only ceased from her sinful living but also poured
out all she had and all she was on the Lord to express her love toward Him.
The law, which condemns us, cannot free us from sin, but grace, which forgives
us, can…. The more we have been forgiven by God, the more we love God. The
reason that sinful woman loved the Lord much was that she was forgiven much
by the Lord. Therefore, God’s forgiveness of man results in man’s fearing Him
and loving Him. (Truth Lessons—Level One, vol. 3, pp. 122-123)

箴三一 4“…君王不可喝淡酒，绝对不可；首领
也不可说，浓酒在哪里？”

Prov. 31:4 …It is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes to say, Where
is strong drink?

9“你当开口按公义审判，为困苦和穷乏人秉持公
理。”

9 Open your mouth; judge righteously, and minister justice to the poor
and needy.

10 ～ 12“才德的妇人谁能得着呢？她的价值远胜
过珠宝。她丈夫心里倚靠她，必不缺少利益。
她一生的日子使丈夫有益无损。”

10-12 Who can find a worthy woman? For her price is far above corals.
The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.
She does him good and not evil all the days of her life.

箴言…末了一章举出两个典范—掌权的君王和才
德的妇人。一面，我们该象主一样是君王，是君尊
的男子，有权柄施行管理；另一面，我们该象才德
的妇人，知道在神的家中当如何安排、经营、料理、
并供应圣徒的需要。

The last chapter [of Proverbs] presents two models: a reigning king and
a worthy woman. On the one hand, we should be a king, a royal man like the
Lord, having the authority to rule. On the other hand, we should be a worthy
woman, knowing how to arrange, manage, take care of, and provide for the
needs of the saints in the house of God.

三至九节说到掌权的君王，他不淫秽、不饮酒，
并为人伸冤、秉持公理。这预表基督和祂的得胜者；
这样的人才能掌权。许多弟兄不能约束自己，所以
不能作王掌权。我们的主完全受神约束，所以祂能
为神掌权。我们为人处事该象君尊的王子。…能叫
人敬畏的人，必是自约的人。〔参歌六 4 下。〕我
们若能受神约束而对付自己，就能为神掌权。
箴言三十一章十至三十一节描绘一个才德的妇
人—她是智慧、仁慈、勤劳且能干的，能料理、安排、
经营并供应她的家。“她的价值远胜过珠宝；”（10；）
她的荣耀超越群伦。这位才德的妇人预表召会和爱主
的圣徒。我们都该象这才德的妇人一样来爱主。（李
常受文集一九五六年第一册—中文尚未出书。）
二○二○年十二月半年度训练 - 第 11 周 晨兴圣言 - 第 11 页

Proverbs 31:3 through 9 speaks of a reigning king—one who is not licentious
and does not drink wine but who speaks for the rights of others and ministers
justice. This typifies Christ and His overcomers. Only this kind of person can
reign. Many brothers cannot restrict themselves; therefore, they cannot reign
as kings. Our Lord was fully under God’s restriction; hence, He could reign for
God. We should conduct ourselves and handle our affairs like royal princes….
Those who restrict themselves are revered by others [cf. S. S. 6:4b]. If we can be
restricted by God and thus deal with ourselves, we will be able to reign for God.

Proverbs 31:10 through 31 describes a worthy woman—one who is wise,
kind, diligent, and capable and who can take care of, arrange, manage, and
provide for her household. “Her price is far above corals” (v. 10); her glory
surpasses all her peers. This worthy woman typifies the church and the
saints who love the Lord. We should all be like this worthy woman in loving
the Lord. (CWWL, 1956, vol. 1, p. 529)

〔箴言三十一章的〕两个典范表征我们一面要象
君王，另一面要象才德的妇人。在得胜方面，我们
要象君王；在爱主方面，我们要象才德的妇人。我
们若能如此，在主面前就有价值和荣耀。

These two models signify that we should be like a king on the one hand and
like a worthy woman on the other hand. In the aspect of overcoming, we should
be like a king; in the aspect of loving the Lord, we should be like a worthy
woman. Being like this will cause us to have value and glory before the Lord.

箴言并不是普通的规劝，乃是说到我们在神面前
该如何为人。…唯有〔象这两个典范那样〕，我们
才能够得上箴言里为人的标准。
箴言头三十章将各种为人的原则和细则，以及一
般智慧的话都说过之后，末了一章举出我们为人的
两个典范。这两个典范表征宇宙中的两个大人物—
神和人；神是掌权的君王，而人该是才德的妇人。
从创世记直到启示录，一直有一条线论到这两个大
人物。在新约里这两个大人物就是基督和召会。我
们的为人一面该象基督一样是掌权的君王，有权柄
施行管理；另一面，我们该象才德的妇人，在神的
家中知道当如何料理、经营、供应。这章里所说的
两个典范含意很深，能使我们从为人、从预表、从
属灵生活、从实用各方面，得着很多的教导，值得
我们学习。（李常受文集一九五六年第一册—中文
尚未出书。）

The proverbs are not ordinary exhortations; rather, they speak of how we
should conduct ourselves before God…. Only in this way can we match the
standard of human conduct seen in the book of Proverbs.
After the first thirty chapters of Proverbs present the principles and
details of human conduct as well as general words of wisdom, its last chapter
shows two models for our human conduct. These two models signify two
great figures in the universe—God and man. God is the reigning King,
and man is the worthy woman. From Genesis to Revelation there is a line
concerning these two great figures. In the New Testament these two great
figures are Christ and the church. On the one hand, we should conduct
ourselves as a reigning king, like Christ, having the authority to rule; on the
other hand, we should conduct ourselves as a worthy woman, knowing how
to arrange, manage, and provide for God’s household. The meaning of these
two models is very deep and can cause us to receive many teachings related
to human conduct, typology, our spiritual life, and practical application. It is
worthy of our learning. (CWWL, 1956, vol. 1, pp. 529-530, 535-536)

Whereas in holding marriage in honor man’s faithfulness is the base,
woman’s virtues are the building up. A gracious woman lays hold of honor
(11:16a). A worthy woman is the crown of her husband (12:4a). The wise
woman builds her house—14:1a. Regarding woman’s virtues, we need to
read 31:10-31. (Life-study of Proverbs, p. 15)

A. In Ecclesiastes 1:2-11 we see that the theme of this book is vanity of
vanities:
1. The central thought of Ecclesiastes is the vanity of vanities of human life
under the sun in its falling away from God—v. 2.
2. The contents of Ecclesiastes are a description of the human life of fallen
mankind under the sun, a life in the corrupted world—Eph. 2:12.

3. The teachings of Solomon in Ecclesiastes show that the human life in the
corrupted world is a vanity, a chasing after wind—1:14.

present, is vanity—12:8.

5. No matter how good, excellent, marvelous, and wonderful a thing may be,
as long as it is of the old creation, it is part of the vanity of vanities under
the sun—1:9; 2:11, 17, 22.

6. Only the new creation, which is in the heavens and not “under the sun”
(1:9), is not vanity but is reality—2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; Eph. 4:24.

B. In Psalm 39:4-6 David realized the nothingness and vanity of his life:

1. In this psalm David was brought by God to realize that he was nothing

v. 5.

2. Our realizing that our condition is sinful (Psa. 38) and that our situation
is one of vanity opens the way for Christ to crucify us and enter into us
to replace us by living Himself through us and causing us to live together
with Him in an organic union, as expressed by Paul in Galatians 2:20.

C. Man was created by God with the highest and most noble purpose,
that is, to express God in His image with His divine life and nature—
Gen. 1:26:

1. God’s enemy, Satan, the devil, came in to inject himself as sin into the
man created by God for His purpose—3:1-6; Rom. 5:18; 3:23; 1 John 3:4.
2. Through this fall of man, man and all the created things that had been
committed by God to his dominion were made subject to vanity (Rom.
8:20-21); thus, human life in the corrupted world also became vanity.

3 逃离这虚空的路，就是回到神那里，在基督里以神
作救赎、生命、财富、享受、快乐和满足，使我
们仍然可以为神所用，以成就神创造人时原初的定
旨，而完成神永远的经纶—传十二 13 ～ 14。

四 虽然在败坏世界里的人生是虚空，是捕风，
但我们需要领悟，神已将永远安置在人心里—
三 11：
1 传道书三章十一节里的“永远”，是“神所栽种，
历代以来就在运行的一种要有目的的感觉；日光之
下，除神以外，别无什么可以满足这感觉”。（The
Amplified Bible，扩大本圣经。）
2 神按着自己的形像创造人，并在人里面造了灵，使
人能接受祂并盛装祂，并且给人造了寻求神自己的
心，使神能作人的满足—创一 26，二 7，亚十二 1。
3 虽然人堕落离开神，并且罪借着撒但进来，阻挠人
接受神作人的满足，但在人心里仍存留着对神的渴
望、对神的寻求—传三 11。
4 短暂的事物绝不能满足人；唯有永远的神，就是
基督，能满足人心深处要有目的的感觉—参林后
四 18。

【周三】

3. The way for us to escape this vanity is to come back to God and take God
in Christ as redemption, life, wealth, enjoyment, pleasure, and satisfaction
so that we may still be used by God to fulfill His original purpose in
creating man for the fulfillment of His eternal economy—Eccl. 12:13-14.

D. Although the human life in the corrupted world is a vanity, a chasing
after wind, we need to realize that God has put eternity in man’s
heart—3:11:
1. “Eternity” in Ecclesiastes 3:11 is “a divinely implanted sense of a purpose
working through the ages which nothing under the sun but God alone can
satisfy” (The Amplified Bible).

2. God created man in His image and formed in him a spirit so that man may
receive and contain Him and have a heart that seeks God Himself so that
God can be man’s satisfaction—Gen. 1:26; 2:7; Zech. 12:1.

3. Although man fell away from God, and sin through Satan came in to
frustrate man from receiving God for his satisfaction, the desire for God,
the seeking for God, still remains in man’s heart—Eccl. 3:11.
4. Temporal things can never satisfy man; only the eternal God, who
is Christ, can satisfy the deep sense of purpose in man’s heart—cf. 2
Cor. 4:18.

A. In Ephesians 4:17 Paul exhorts the believers to “no longer walk as the
Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind”:
1. The basic element in the daily life of fallen mankind is the vanity of the mind.
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 12 - Page 3

2 外邦人是堕落之人，在他们的推想上变为虚妄—罗
一 21：
a 他们在心思的虚妄里，行事为人没有神，受他们虚
妄思想的控制和摆布。
b 在神的眼中和使徒保罗的眼中，世人所想、所说、
所作的，不过是虚妄。
3 外邦人在他们心思的虚妄里行事为人，因着心里的
刚硬，就在悟性上昏暗了—弗四 18：
a 当堕落之人的心思充满虚妄，他们的悟性在神的事
上就昏暗了—诗九四 11。
b 堕落之人心里的刚硬，乃是他悟性昏暗、心思虚妄
的根源—弗四 17 ～ 18。

二 在以弗所四章十七节和二十一节，有那在耶稣
身上的实际与在堕落之人心思里之虚妄的对照：
1 堕落之人不敬虔的行事为人乃是虚妄；但在耶稣敬
虔的生活里乃是实际。
2 那在耶稣身上的实际就是二十四节里所提到新人的
“那实际”：
a 那迷惑（22）是撒但的人位化，那实际（24）是神
的人位化；那迷惑是魔鬼，那实际乃是神。
b 神是那实际，展示在耶稣的生活里—21 节。

【周四】
3 那在耶稣身上的实际，是指四福音书所记载耶稣一
生的真实光景：
a 耶稣的人性生活是照着这实际，就是照着神自己—
弗四 24。

2. The Gentiles, the nations, are the fallen people, who have become vain in
their reasonings—Rom. 1:21:
a. They walk without God in the vanity of their mind and are controlled and
directed by their vain thoughts.

b. In the eyes of God and of the apostle Paul, whatever the people in the world
think, say, and do is nothing but vanity.

3. The nations who walk in the vanity of the mind are darkened in their
understanding because of the hardness of their heart—Eph. 4:18:
a. When the mind of fallen people is filled with vanity, their understanding is
darkened in the things of God—Psa. 94:11.

b. The hardness of fallen man’s heart is the source of the darkness in his
understanding and the vanity of his mind—Eph. 4:17-18.

B. In Ephesians 4:17 and 21 there is a contrast between the reality in
Jesus and the vanity of the fallen human mind:

1. In the godless walk of fallen man there is vanity, but in the godly life of
Jesus there is reality.
2. The reality in Jesus is “the reality” of the new man mentioned in verse 24:

a. The deceit (v. 22) is the personification of Satan, and the reality (v. 24) is the
personification of God; the deceit is the devil, and the reality is God.
b. God as the reality was exhibited in the life of Jesus—v. 21.

§Day 4

3. The reality in Jesus is the actual condition of the life of Jesus recorded in
the four Gospels:
a. The human living of Jesus was according to the reality, that is, according to
God Himself—Eph. 4:24.
2020 December Semiannual Training - Holy Word Morning Revival Outline - Week 12 - Page 4

b 耶稣生活的素质就是实际；祂行事为人总是在实际中。
c 主在祂人性生活中所作的一切，都是神的彰显，所
以就是实际。
4 耶稣这种照着实际的生活，乃是信徒生活的模型—
约贰 1 ～ 2，4，约叁 3 ～ 4：
a 我们需要学基督，并在祂里面受教导，过实际的生
活—弗四 20 ～ 21，约贰 1，约四 23 ～ 24。
b 我们是基督身体的肢体，该过一种实际的生活，如
同那在耶稣身上的实际—一种彰显神的生活。

三 我们能活在那在耶稣身上的实际里，因为“我
们…在那位真实的里面”—约壹五 20：
1 “那位真实的”是指神对我们成了主观的，指客观
的神在我们的生活和经历中成了那真实者。
2 在那位真实的—那真实者—里面，就是在祂儿子耶
稣基督里面，因为神的儿子主耶稣就是真神—20 节。
3 那真实者就是神圣的实际；认识那真实者，意即借
着经历、享受并拥有这实际，而认识这神圣的实际。

【周五】

b. The essence of the life of Jesus was reality; He always walked in reality.

c. Everything the Lord did in His human life was God expressed and therefore
was reality.

4. The life of Jesus according to reality is the pattern for the believers’ life—
2 John 1-2, 4; 3 John 3-4:

a. We need to learn Christ and be taught in Him to live a life of reality—Eph.
4:20-21; 2 John 1; John 4:23-24.
b. As members of the Body of Christ, we should live a life of reality, as the reality
is in Jesus—a life of expressing God.

C. We can live in the reality that is in Jesus because “we are in Him who
is true”—1 John 5:20:
1. Him who is true refers to God becoming subjective to us, to the God who
is objective becoming the true One in our life and experience.
2. To be in the One who is true—the true One—is to be in His Son Jesus
Christ, for the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, is the true God—v. 20.

3. The true One is the divine reality; to know the true One means to know
the divine reality by experiencing, enjoying, and possessing this reality.

传一 2“传道者说，虚空的虚空，虚空的虚空，
凡事都是虚空。”

Eccl. 1:2 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; vanity of vanities; all is
vanity.

9“已有的事，后必再有；已作的事，后必再作。
日光之下并无新事。”

9 What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be
done, and there is nothing new under the sun.

14“我见日光之下所作的一切工，看哪，都是虚
空，都是捕风。”

14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and indeed, all is
vanity and a chasing after wind.

传道书的内容是所罗门在堕落离开神，又回转归
向神之后，对堕落人类在日光之下，在败坏世界中
之人生的描绘。他专心寻求、查究天下所作的一切，
他观察到照着自然的现象，万事都是循环，一代又
一代都是一样，令人厌烦，并无新事。他下结论说，
对堕落人类的人生而言，这一切都是虚空的虚空，
都是捕风。智慧的王，凭他的智慧所得这样的结论，
可以看作是堕落之人虚空人生的历史。他在这卷书
中的结论，就象结局悲惨之人的挽歌。（传道书生
命读经，二页。）

The contents of Ecclesiastes are a description by Solomon, after his falling
away from God and returning back to God, concerning the human life of fallen
mankind under the sun, which is in the corrupted world. He set his heart to
seek and to search out all that is done under the heavens, and he observed
that according to the natural phenomena all the things done in cycle remain
the same, generation after generation, all wearisome and nothing new. In his
conclusion, this is all vanity of vanities and a chasing after wind to the human
life of fallen mankind. Such a conclusion of the wise king by his wisdom may be
considered a history of the vain life of a fallen man. His conclusion in this book
is like a dirge to a man whose end is in misery. (Life-study of Ecclesiastes, pp. 1-2)

According to Ecclesiastes, human history, from its beginning to the
present, is vanity…. Paul’s word concerning this in Romans 8:20-21
corresponds to Ecclesiastes. Today everyone is actually not living but
dying. We have been born to die; that is, we have been dying since the day
of our birth. From this we see that human life under the sun is vanity of
vanities.

of his lust to an unparalleled extent. Through all the positive and negative
experiences of the human life under the sun, his thought was deeply
impressed and occupied with the central thought of this book, that is, the
vanity of vanities of the human life under the sun in its falling away from
God. Man was created by God with the highest and most noble purpose,
that is, to express Him in the resemblance of Him in His life, nature, and
expression. But God’s enemy, Satan the devil, came in to inject himself as sin
into the man created by God for His purpose. Through this fall of man, man
and all the created things that had been committed by God to his dominion
were brought into the slavery of corruption, made subject to vanity (Rom.
8:20-21). Thus, the human life in the corrupted world also became a vanity,
a chasing after wind. The writer Solomon had fully realized this and stressed
this to the uttermost in his description. Yet he was not fully disappointed in
this, but rather he instructed men that there is a way to get out of this vanity,
that is, to come back to God and take God as man’s everything, redemption,
life, wealth, enjoyment, pleasure, and satisfaction, that man still may be used
by God to fulfill His original purpose in man for the fulfillment of His eternal
economy (Eccl. 12:13-14). (Life-study of Ecclesiastes, pp. 2-3)
Proverbs is on the real wisdom, and Ecclesiastes is on the real meaning of
the human life under the sun, which is vanity of vanities, a chasing after wind.
Song of Songs is the satisfaction of satisfactions. Apart from Christ, there is
no satisfaction in the whole universe. The unique Christ, the embodiment
of God, is the unique satisfaction not only to man but to the entire universe,
which has been made subject to vanity (Rom. 8:20). The fact that the creation
is now subject to vanity means that everything under the sun is vanity.
Today God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is realized as the compounded,
sevenfold, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, who is the consummation of the
processed Triune God. This indwelling One is our subjective satisfaction.

传三 11“神造万物，各按其时成为美好，又将永
远安置在世人心里…。”

Eccl. 3:11 He has made everything beautiful in its own time; also He has
put eternity in their heart…

林后四 18“我们原不是顾念所见的，乃是顾念所
不见的，因为所见的是暂时的，所不见的才是
永远的。”

2 Cor. 4:18 Because we do not regard the things which are seen but the
things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporary,
but the things which are not seen are eternal.

神…将永远（就是对永远之事的渴望）安置在世
人心里…。（传三 11。）神造人时，将所罗门所称
为“永远”的东西放在人里面。这就是说，在人里
面有一种对神的渴望，对永远之事的渴望。物质的
事也许是可享受的，却是暂时的。

God…has put eternity (an aspiration for the things in eternity) in man’s
heart…(Eccl. 3:11). In His creation of man, God put something into man
which Solomon called “eternity.” This means that in man there is a kind of
aspiration for God, an aspiration for something eternal. Physical things may
be enjoyable, but they are temporal.

许多成功的人能见证，他们竭力在事业上晋升
时，里面就觉得虚空。他们开始领悟，他们在寻
求永远的事。他们得着所要得的东西以后，就觉
得那算不得什么。这种感觉来自人心里对永远之
事的渴望。
照着我们自己的经历，我们知道，每当我们在人
生中有所成功的时候，也有虚空的感觉。这指明在
人里面有对永远之事的渴望。神已将这样的渴望，
这样的寻求，放在人的心里，使人寻求神。每个人，
尤其每个有思想的人，里面都有这种对永远的渴望
和寻求。（传道书生命读经，七至八页。）

Many successful people can testify that when they were endeavoring
to advance in their career, they sensed that there was an emptiness within
them. They began to realize that they were seeking something eternal. After
they gained something they wanted, they felt that it was nothing. This feeling
comes from the aspiration in man’s heart for something eternal.

According to our own experience, we know that whenever we have a
success in our human life, we also have an empty feeling. This indicates
that within man there is an aspiration for eternal things. God has put such
an aspiration, such a seeking, in man’s heart so that he will seek God. Every
person, especially every thoughtful person, has within him this longing and
seeking for eternity. (Life-study of Ecclesiastes, pp. 5-6)

Today’s Reading

God created man in His image and with a human spirit for man to receive
and contain Him. Ecclesiastes 3:11 says that God put eternity in man’s heart.
The things in this universe are mainly of two categories: temporal things
and eternal things. In 2 Corinthians 4:18 Paul says, “We do not regard the

罗门在传道书三章十一节之话的正确解释。智慧的王
说，神造万物，各按其时成为美好，又将永远安置在
人心里。这与我们人的经历是相合的。一个人无论多

要得着永久的事物，而唯有永远的事物才是永久的。
扩大本英文圣经说，在人心里的这永远，乃是“神所

things which are seen but the things which are not seen; for the things which
are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.” This
verse is the proper explanation of Solomon’s word in Ecclesiastes 3:11. The
wise king said that God created everything beautiful in its own time and also
put eternity in man’s heart. This matches our human experience. Regardless
of how rich or successful a person becomes, he still feels empty. Man has a
deep desire for permanent things, and the only things that are permanent
are the eternal things. The Amplified Bible says that eternity in man’s heart
is “a divinely implanted sense of a purpose working through the ages which
nothing under the sun, but only God, can satisfy.” We have a sense of a
purpose, which nothing can satisfy but God. Only God can satisfy the sense of
purpose in our heart.
In God’s creation of man there are three striking things: His image, our
human spirit to receive Him, and a divinely implanted sense of a purpose
in our hearts working through the ages, which nothing under the sun, but
only God, can satisfy. The romance depicted in Song of Songs does not start
from the Lord but from the seeker. A person becomes such a seeker because
within him there is a sense of purpose to seek something eternal. Nothing
can fulfill or satisfy this sense of purpose but God Himself, who is Christ.
Many people would think that we are wasting our time, but actually, we are
redeeming the time. Those who pursue temporary things are wasting their
time. They are busy for nothing. Anything they are busy for is temporary, not
eternal. Only One in the whole universe is eternal—the eternal God. (CWWL,
1994-1997, vol. 3, “The God-man Living,” pp. 444-445)
David said that man goes about as a semblance, an empty show, and that
people are bustling about in vain [Psa. 39:6].
God wants us to be nothing. God wants us to be replaced by Christ…. I
have an organic union with Him. He lives and works, and I live and work with
Him. Christ replaces me to live Himself through me. (Life-study of the Psalms,

Eph. 4:17 This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer
walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind.

20 ～ 21“但你们并不是这样学了基督；如果你们
真是听过祂，并在祂里面，照着那在耶稣身上

20-21 But you did not so learn Christ, if indeed you have heard Him and
have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus.

外邦人是堕落的人，在他们的推想上变为虚妄。
（罗一 21。）他们在心思的虚妄里，行事为人没有神，
受他们虚妄思想的控制和摆布。凡他们照着堕落的心
思所作的，都是虚妄，没有实际。…保罗在以弗所四
章十七节的劝勉，含示我们信徒得救前在心思的虚妄
里行事为人，得救后仍可能继续如此行。甚至在基督
徒中间，那些不彰显神的宗教活动和作法—如圣诞节
和复活节—乃是迷信、虚假、欺骗和虚妄。我们身为
信徒，不该再在心思的虚妄里行事为人。相反地，我
们应当让新人将神活出来；新人生活的每一细节，都
必须是神彰显在我们的生活里。这就是不再在心思的
虚妄里行事为人，乃照着那在耶稣身上是实际者，过
新人的生活。（新约总论第十一册，二一九页。）

The Gentiles are the fallen people, who become vain in their reasonings
(Rom. 1:21). They walk without God in the vanity of their mind, being
controlled and directed by their vain thoughts. Whatever they do according
to their fallen mind is vanity, void of reality…. Paul’s exhortation in Ephesians
4:17 suggests that we the believers, who once walked in the vanity of the
mind before we were saved, may continue to do so after we are saved. Even
religious activities and practices among Christians which do not express
God—such as Christmas and Easter—are superstition, falsehood, deception,
and vanity. As believers, we should no longer walk in the vanity of the mind.
Instead, we should allow the new man to live out God; every detail of the
living of the new man must be God expressed in our living. This is to no
longer walk in the vanity of the mind but to live the life of the new man as the
reality is in Jesus. (The Conclusion of the New Testament, p. 3428)

In Ephesians 4:17-32 we see that Christ is the reality and grace for the

came with grace and reality; that is, when Christ came, grace and reality
came with Him. [In John 1:14 and 17] we see that grace and reality are

个新人；今天这新人乃是在地上。四章十七至三十二
节接着启示，新人生活的路乃是借着实际与恩典。…
保罗在十七至二十一节以及二十四节陈明那在耶稣身
上的实际，使我们不再在心思的虚妄里行事为人。
〔在二十一节〕保罗不是说，在基督身上是实际
者；他乃是说，在耶稣身上是实际者。这是因为当主
耶稣作为人在地上生活时，在祂身上总是实际。在耶
稣身上，也就是在祂的人性生活和日常行事为人里—
无论是作木匠或是尽祂的职事—实际总是在那里。要
明白耶稣作为人在地上生活时，在祂的生活中所彰显
的实际，我们需要读十七节；保罗在这节劝勉信徒不
要再“象外邦人在他们心思的虚妄里行事为人”。这
里我们看见，在耶稣身上是实际者与在外邦人心思里
的虚妄相对。在耶稣的人性生活里，没有虚妄，只有
实际；然而，在我们无神的社会里，没有别的，只有
虚空的虚空。我们也许可以用本仁约翰所著“天路历
程”中的一句话来说，整体而言，今天的世界是一个
“浮华世界”。今天世界上的财富、名声、地位、娱
乐和财物都是虚空，但在那人耶稣日常生活中的一切
都是实际。祂在为人生活中所作的一切都是实际；祂
所说的话没有一句是虚妄的。（参彼前二 22。）
基督对我们不仅是生命，也是榜样。（约十三 15，
彼前二 21。）在祂地上的生活中，祂设立了一个榜样，
如福音书中所启示的。此后，祂钉死并复活成了赐生命
的灵，使祂可以进到我们里面，作我们的生命。我们照
着祂的榜样跟祂学，（太十一 29，）不是凭我们天然
的生命，乃是凭祂在复活里作我们的生命。我们学了基

Ephesians presents reality and grace as a pair for the living of the new
man. Ephesians 2:15 tells us that Christ created the one new man; the new
man is on the earth today. Ephesians 4:17-32 goes on to reveal that the way
for the new man to live is by reality and grace. In Ephesians 4:17-21 and 24,
Paul presents the reality in Jesus for a walk that is no longer in the vanity of
the mind.

[In verse 21] Paul does not say that the reality is in Christ; rather, he
says that the reality is in Jesus. The reason for this is that when the Lord
Jesus lived on earth as a man, in Him there was always the reality. In Jesus,
that is, in His human living and His daily walk—whether He worked as a
carpenter or carried out His ministry—there was the reality at all times.
In order to understand the reality expressed in the living of Jesus as a man
on earth, we need to read verse 17, where Paul exhorts the believers to “no
longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind.” Here we
see a contrast between the reality in Jesus and the vanity of the Gentiles’
mind. In the human living of Jesus there was no vanity but only the reality;
however, in our godless society there is nothing but vanity of vanities.
Using a phrase from John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress, we may say
that, as a whole, today’s world is a “vanity fair.” Wealth, fame, position,
entertainment, and material possessions in today’s world are all vanities,
but everything in the daily living of the man Jesus is the reality. Whatever
He did in His human living is the reality; not one of His words was vain (cf.
1 Pet. 2:22).

Christ is not only life to us but also an example (John 13:15; 1 Pet. 2:21).
In His life on earth He set up a pattern, as revealed in the Gospels. Then He
was crucified and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit that He might
enter into us to be our life. We learn from Him (Matt. 11:29) according to
His example, not by our natural life but by Him as our life in resurrection. To
learn Christ is simply to be molded into the pattern of Christ, that is, to be
conformed to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29). (The Conclusion of the New
Testament, pp. 3425-3426)

弗四 24“并且穿上了新人，这新人是照着神，在
那实际的义和圣中所创造的。”

Eph. 4:24 And put on the new man, which was created according to God
in righteousness and holiness of the reality.

约壹五 20“我们也晓得神的儿子已经来到，且将
悟性赐给我们，使我们可以认识那位真实的；
我们也在那位真实的里面，就是在祂儿子耶稣
基督里面。这是真神，也是永远的生命。”

1 John 5:20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given
us an understanding that we might know Him who is true; and we are
in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and
eternal life.

〔在以弗所四章二十一节，〕“那在耶稣身上是
实际者”这说法是指耶稣一生的真实光景，如四福音
书所记载的。外邦堕落之人不敬虔的行事为人乃是
虚妄；但在耶稣敬虔的生活里乃是实际。耶稣在生活
中总是在神里面，同着神并为着神行事。神是在祂的
生活中，并且祂与神是一。这就是在耶稣身上是实际
者。我们信徒既以基督作我们的生命得了重生，并在
祂里面受过教导，就照着那在耶稣身上是实际者学了
基督。（新约总论第十一册，二一七页。）

The expression the reality is in Jesus [in Ephesians 4:21] refers to the
actual condition of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels. In the
godless walk of the nations, the fallen people, there is vanity, but in the godly
life of Jesus there is the reality. Jesus lived a life in which He did everything
in God, with God, and for God. God was in His living, and He was one with
God. This is what is meant by the reality is in Jesus. We, the believers, who
are regenerated with Christ as our life and are taught in Him, learn from
Him as the reality is in Jesus. (The Conclusion of the New Testament, pp.

In His daily walk the man Jesus was not only great but also very fine. For
example, when He fed five thousand men with five loaves and two fish,… He
instructed His disciples to gather the broken pieces left over that nothing may
be lost, which amounted to twelve handbaskets full (John 6:12-13). The four
Gospels reveal that in every detail of the Lord’s daily living, there is no vanity
but only the reality. Moreover, in nearly every page of the four Gospels, we see a
striking contrast between the reality in the godly living of Jesus and the vanity
in the living of others around Him, such as His opposers as well as His disciples.

In His thirty-three and a half years on earth, the Lord Jesus formed the
mold, the pattern, to which all those who believe in Him are to be conformed.

According to the record of the four Gospels, the life of the Lord Jesus was a
life of reality. Reality is the shining of light. Light is the source, and reality is
its expression. As Hebrews 1:3 says, the Lord Jesus is the effulgence of God’s
glory. This means that He is the shining of God who is light. Because in every
aspect of the Lord’s living on earth there was the shining of light, His life was
a life of reality, a life of the shining of God Himself. That life of reality was
the expression of God. For this reason Paul says that we learn Christ as the
reality is in Jesus. In other words, we learn Christ according to the mold of
the life of Jesus, which is the reality.
After Christ established this mold, He passed through death and
resurrection, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. As such a
Spirit, He comes into us to be our life. When we believed in Christ and were
baptized, God put us into Him as the mold, just as dough is placed into a
mold. By being put into the mold we learn the mold. This means that by being
put into Christ, we learn Christ. On the one hand, God put us into Christ; on
the other hand, Christ has come into us to be our life. Now we may live by
Him according to the mold in which we have been placed by God. We are in
Christ as the mold, and He is in us as our life. In this way we learn Christ as
the reality is in Jesus.
In Ephesians 4 before Paul mentions grace, that is, the supply, he presents
the reality, that is, the principle, the pattern, and the standard. The reality
is the shining of light; as members of the Body of Christ under the Head,
we should learn Christ as the reality is in Jesus. Yet in order to live out this
standard of the reality, we must have grace. In verse 29 Paul relates grace to
our speaking. This indicates that we need grace for the details of our daily
life, not merely for what we regard as important matters…. For instance, in
our daily conversation we may be devoid of grace…. If we have grace in this
aspect of our living, we will have grace in every other aspect. In all things
we need grace to live a life according to the reality that is in Jesus. (The
Conclusion of the New Testament, pp. 3427-3429)

slavery. This is the reason that the entire creation is awaiting that time. We

甚至我们受苦时，我们也有享受。我们尝到主的同
在。主的同在就是那灵作初熟的果子给我们享受。
所以我们与属世的人不同。他们经历叹息，没有内
里的享受；然而，我们外面叹息，里面却欢乐。…
我们欢乐，因为我们有那灵的初熟果子。我们里面
神圣的灵乃是对神的预尝，将我们引到对神的全享。
这是儿子名分的福分中很大的一项。（罗马书生命
读经，二七一至二七二页。）

If you talk with unbelievers, they will admit that, in a sense, they have
some enjoyment in their entertainments, like dancing and gambling.
However, they will also tell you that they are unhappy….They also are
groaning, but only groaning; there is nothing else. We, on the contrary, as
we are groaning, have within us the Spirit as the firstfruits, as the foretaste
of God Himself. Even as we are suffering, we have the enjoyment. We have
the taste of the presence of the Lord. The presence of the Lord is simply the
Spirit as the firstfruits for our enjoyment. So, we are different from worldly
people. They experience groaning without the inward enjoyment. We,
however, groan outwardly, but rejoice inwardly….We rejoice because we have
the firstfruits of the Spirit. The divine Spirit within us is the foretaste of God
which leads us to the full taste of the enjoyment of God. This is a great item in
the blessings of sonship. (Life-study of Romans, p. 228)

While we are groaning and enjoying the firstfruits of the Spirit, we are
expecting sonship…. Although we have sonship within us, this sonship
has not yet become full….What is full sonship? It is the redemption of our
body. We have sonship in our spirit through regeneration and we may
also have son-ship in our soul through transformation, but we do not as

着改变形状，在我们的身体里得着儿子的名分。在要来
的日子，我们也要在我们的身体里得着儿子的名分。这
是完满的儿子名分，是我们所专切期望的。
我们来看得荣的事。…罗马八章十九节说，“受
造之物正在专切期望着，热切等待神的众子显示出
来。”…“显示”…意思是揭开幔子。…我们虽是
神的众子，却被遮蔽，还未显示出来。主耶稣在地
上时，祂是神的儿子，但祂被属人的肉体所遮蔽。
有一天在山上祂除去幔子，并显示出来。（太十七
1 ～ 2。）我们也是一样。我们虽是神的众子，却在
幔子之下。有一天这幔子要挪去—那将是我们的得
荣。…然后全宇宙都要观看神的众子。
受造之物正在专切期望着，热切等待要看见神的
众子这样显示出来，因为“受造之物服在虚空之下，
不是自己愿意的，乃是因那叫它服的，指望着受造之
物自己，也要从败坏的奴役得着释放，得享神儿女之
荣耀的自由”。（罗八 20 ～ 21。）…受造之物唯一
的盼望，就是神的众子显示出来时，受造之物就要从
这败坏的奴役得着释放，得享神儿女之荣耀的自由。
虽然一切受造之物目前都被拘留在虚空和败坏的光
景里，但神要带进一个国度，顶替目前这光景。目前
的光景是虚空和败坏之奴役的光景；要来的国将是神
荣耀的国，主要由神显示出来的众子所组成。当这国
显示出来的时候，一切受造之物都要得着释放。受
造之物正在专切期望着，热切等待这国来临。因此，
“一切受造之物一同叹息，一同受生产之苦，直到如
今。”（22。）宇宙在叹息并受生产之苦，等待神的
众子显示出来。不但如此，就是我们“这有那灵作初
熟果子的”，也是自己叹息，热切等待儿子的名分，
就是我们的身体得赎。（23。）（罗马书生命读经，
二七二、二九八至二九九页。）

yet have sonship in our body through transfiguration. In the coming day
we will also have sonship in our body. This is full son-ship, our longing
expectation.

We come…to the matter of glorification…. [Romans 8:19 says], “For the
anxious watching of the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons
of God.”… Revelation means to open the veil…. Although we are the sons of
God, we are veiled, not yet revealed. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He
was the Son of God, but He was veiled by His human flesh. One day on the
mountain He was unveiled and revealed (Matt. 17:1-2). It is the same with
us. Although we are sons of God, yet we are under a veil. One day this veil will
be removed—that will be our glorification….Then the whole universe will
behold the sons of God.

The creation is eagerly expecting and anxiously watching to see this
revelation of the sons of God, because “the creation was made subject to
vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that
the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the
freedom of the glory of the children of God” (Rom. 8:20-21)….Creation’s
only hope is to be freed from this slavery of corruption into the freedom
of the glory of the children of God when the sons of God are revealed.
Although the entire creation is presently held in a condition of vanity and
corruption, God will bring in a kingdom to replace this present condition.
The present condition is a condition of vanity and slavery of corruption;
the coming kingdom will be a kingdom of the glory of God, a kingdom
composed primarily of revealed sons of God. At the time of the revelation
of this kingdom the whole creation will be liberated. The creation is eagerly
expecting and anxiously watching for this kingdom to come. Thus, “the whole
creation groans together and travails in pain together until now” (v. 22).
The universe is groaning and travailing in birth awaiting the revelation of
the sons of God. Furthermore, we ourselves, “who have the firstfruits of the
Spirit,” also groan as we expect sonship, the redemption of our body (v. 23).

2. All creation groans together,
Subject now to vanity,
Looking for their full deliv’rance
From corruption’s slavery.

5. God will bring us into glory,
We will then be glorified;
Fully saturated with Him,
We’ll be wholly sanctified.

3. Even we ourselves are groaning,
Till we reach maturity;
We are growing to adoption,
With Christ in conformity.

6. To the freedom of this glory,
All creation will be freed;
With the kid shall lie the leopard,
And the cow with bear shall feed.

4. ’Tis for this the Spirit groaneth,
That to Christ we be conformed;
All things also work together,
That in life we be transformed.

7. Heirs with Christ in full adoption,
We’ll His heritage possess,
Glorified with Him as brethren,
God’s full glory we’ll express.
